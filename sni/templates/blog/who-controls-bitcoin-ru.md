## Кто Контролирует Биткоин?

Расхожий и понятный страх, что Биткоин -- это вещь, которая может быть повреждена на уровне протокола для удовлетворения особых интересов более, чем в результате воздействия со стороны серой массы. Например, могут быть реализованы такие  изменения, которые сделают Биткоин менее анонимным, или превратят его в централизованную систему. Этот вопрос на самом деле о том, кто может влиять на развитие протокола и кто может блокировать это развитие. Любой человек может осуществить форк Биткоина, но предположим, что существовали обновления, предложенные группой очень влиятельных людей -- разрабочиков Core, и предположим, что это могло бы привести к хард-форку Биткоина в некотором фундаментальном и спорном направлении. Разработчики Core говорили, что такое обновление -- это хорошая идея, предположим, они были наняты АНБ. Вопрос, на который я собираюсь ответить здесь, каким бы образом могло бы быть предотвращено такое обновление, прежде чем оно приобрело бы статус стандарта. Иными словами, кто контролирует Биткоин?

## Новый и Классический

Мы предположим, что существует реальное разногласие о некоем обновлении, в том, хорошая или плохая идея реализация такого обновления. Потому что в ином случае, не существовало бы никакой проблемы. Поэтому, как только выпущен релиз обновления, сеть разделяется. Любой может выбрать, какому форку следовать, или даже следовать обоим версиям одновременно. Положительно, с этого момента существует два Биткоина. Я назову их Новый Биткоин и Биткоин Классический. Каждый имеет свою собственную сеть, и каждый, кто владел биткоинами до момента расщепления цепочек, имеет одинаковое количество Нового и Классического Биткоина.

Кто может остановить Новый Биткоин от того, чтобы одержать победу? Это обсуждение на BitcoinTalk (нет ссылки в оригинале) утверждает, что люди, которые поддерживают узлы сети могут остановить обновление, отказываясь от него. Это справедливо, что если, буквально, никто не обновит программное обеспечение, Новый Биткоин проиграет. Однако, также является правдой, что единичное решение обновлять клиент или нет не влияет на сеть в целом. Большое количество узлов сети являются просто балластом. Даже полные узлы (под которыми я подразумеваю узлы, которые хранят и валидируют весь блокчейн) не определяют исход в значительной мере. Полный узел не делает ничего такого, что не могут выполнят другие узлы, и в порядке синхронизации с сетью, им необходимо столько данных, сколько они могут обеспечить. Сеть может нормально функционировать лишь с небольшим количеством полных узлов. Поэтому, Новый Биткоин не обязательно прекратит своё существование даже если полные узлы не будут обновлять программное обеспечение.

The nodes that really matter are the ones that provide valuable services. It doesn't matter if you upgrade. What matters is if Coinbase, BitStamp, and Blockchain.info upgrade. These nodes provide a lot of the infrastructure for Bitcoin, so if they do not upgrade, Bitcoin New will be a lot less useful. However, these nodes are in it for profit, so they will tend to go where the money is. They cannot necessarily afford to wield the influence they might have at the risk of short-term losses. Therefore, they do not necessarily have as great an effect on the outcome as it might at first seem.1

What about the miners? If they refuse to mine on the new chain, that will stop Bitcoin New in its tracks, right? Well no! Miners are in it for the money too, and if Bitcoin Classic cannot support the same hash rate as Bitcoin New, then they put more resources into mining Bitcoin New. Thus, miners also do not necessarily have much of a say in the matter either.

It all boils down to the value of the two coins. If Bitcoin New becomes more valuable than Bitcoin Classic, then miners will mine it and services will support it. If not, then it won't. Investors settle the question. A Bitcoin investor can sell his Bitcoin New for Bitcoin Classic, or vice versa, depending on which he thinks is the better idea.

In both the cases of the service providers and the miners, the problem which makes them less influential than one might think is the fact that they do not necessarily have the funds to take the risk of deciding for themselves which version they like better and which they are going to promote. In short, the problem is that they are not necessarily investors, who by definition do have the funds. Investors do not have to listen to anybody else because they can afford to take the risk of asserting influence. Thus, it is the investors who control Bitcoin.

## Flowing Uphill

Clearly there are technical issues with problem of creating a viable Bitcoin fork that I didn't go into. For example, a Bitcoin fork might not be able to work because its hash rate would initially be so low that blocks could take days or weeks to mine. Since there has never been a battle between two forks before, there are a lot of unknowns about how to do it right, but technical issues like that could be addressed if they were properly researched.

The real issue is not precisely how a Bitcoin fork could actually be implemented, but merely the understanding of how events would play out in such a situation. Hypothetical situations affect reality today. When two armies meet, if they can determine who would win without actually fighting one another, then the battle is over without having begin. This is a similar situation. If a Bitcoin upgrade were known to be unpopular to investors, then its proponents, knowing who would win if push came to shove, would tend to back down before causing that much disruption. Thus, the investors are still in control even for real-life Bitcoin upgrades that never reach the point of creating such contention.

What are the implications of this conclusion? The motivation of investors is the value of the coin. The general rule about Bitcoin upgrades, therefore, is that upgrades which increase Bitcoin's value will be adopted and those which do not will not. Therefore, Bitcoin is not likely to be upgraded in ways which make it easier to regulate because that would decrease the value of the coins. Bitcoin might be upgraded in ways that make it more anonymous because a more anonymous coin would likely be more valuable. An upgrade which allows for larger block sizes is also likely to be adopted because the current limit of 1 MB will eventually limit Bitcoin's value as a form of money. Obvious bug fixes are likely to be adopted, whereas cockamamie schemes which do not clearly improve Bitcoin's value-such as proof-of-stake mining or changing the block reward schedule-have no real chance of succeeding and are therefore hardly worth talking about.

This is not to say that Bitcoin is a divine substance or some immaculate bit of quintessence. It just means that Bitcoin upgrades must be a clear improvement to Bitcoin as an investment or else they face a sharp uphill battle to adoption. Any scheme to reprogram it in service of special interests would almost certainly reduce its value proposition because it would change Bitcoin from something good for the world to something good for a smaller group. Of course, people actually need to be paying attention in order to prevent it, but we also don't need to go mad with hypervigilance.

## Footnotes

   1. I have learned that Emin Gün Sirer has expressed a similar idea in a [blog post](http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/06/19/bitcoin-and-voting-power/). However, he argues that it is the users who control bitcoin, having one vote per node. When I originally wrote this article, I didn’t deal with this this case extensively because I didn’t realize anyone was taking that position. So I am dealing with the full nodes in this note now.

   Consider the following thought experiment. Suppose, as again, that there were two forks of Bitcoin, new and classic. Now suppose that new was preferred by investors and classic was preferred by people who run full nodes. As the two classes of people expressed their preference in their actions, the investors would tend to cause an increase in the market cap of new over classic, while the node runners would tend to increase the number of nodes of classic over new. What has each class gained by this? The investors have gained an asset capable of producing a greater financial impact on the world than that of their competitors’ and therefore more capable of attracting business. While the nodes do control a network, in a sense, the investors control which network becomes important.

   Over a sufficiently long time span, therefore, the interest of those who now run full nodes become meaningless in comparison to the desires of those who are now investors. There are many reasons to run a node and consequently the class of people who run full nodes is less capable of maintaining a consistent set of interests or a group identity. The investors can, and their actions can be expected to alter the composition of the group of full node runners in a way that is not matched by the effect which the full node runners have on the investors.

   Consequently, an individual person’s control over Bitcoin should is better characterized in terms of the amount he owns than in how many nodes he runs. This is why I say your control over Bitcoin is proportional to how much you own and why I say that it is the investors, not the network nodes, who control Bitcoin. ↩

[^1]: I noticed the page setting forth the terms of the DAO has disappeared and
I had to link to it through the Wayback Machine. If I wrote something like
this, I’d be embarrassed too, but jeez guys, don’t make the _1984_ comparisons
so easy. Let me just quote the opening paragraph in full so that people don’t
forget:

    > The terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart contract code
    > existing on the Ethereum blockchain at
    > 0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413. Nothing in this explanation of

    This is why the DAO exploit was legal. If a bunch of computer code is a
    contract and there’s nothing else to explain what it is intended to do, then
    you can’t just point to some behavior it exhibits and pretend it never
    happened just because you call it a bug.

    I am not saying that the bug in the DAO was not obviously a bug; I am saying
    that similar cases are possible which are not so clear-cut. The devs are
    opening up an endless unresolvable debate by intervening. Ultimately, the only
    way to distinguish between an obvious bug and one which is not so obvious is
    to have some subjective principle embodied in a bunch of specific cases that a
    human has to look at and make a judgement. That’s just the legal system we
    have now and I thought that’s what Ethereum was supposed to avoid. Also, did
    you know that DAO stands for “distributed autonomous organization”? Well
    obviously it’s _not_ that if it needs a central body to fix it every time it
    screws up.

[^2]: Also, don’t take this as a recommendation. Just because I took a risk
does not mean you should.

[^3]: Note that if ETC wins, the miners will have had nothing to do with it.
The miners who chose to mine ETC instead of ETH chose it because it was more
profitable to mine, not because they thought it was better. Thus, the miners
do not control Ethereum. The investors control which fork is more profitable
to mine, and therefore they control the miners.

[^4]: Although Rawls is considered to be more of a socialist and Hayek more of
a libertarian, their philosophies are pretty similar, although I think Hayek's
fits better here because Hayek specifically emphasized the importance of
abstract rules, whereas Rawls is more interested in preventing class interests
from influencing our politics.

    Now note that I’m not saying here that Ethereum investors should necessarily
    be treated like free citizens with certain rights, as we would expect in a
    free society. They choose to buy into Ethereum. I’m saying that they can also
    choose to _sell_ Ethereum, and if they’re not going to be treated like the
    people in charge, why shouldn’t they? It would be perfectly appropriate under
    some circumstances, such as in a MMORPG, to make a centrally managed currency
    with a bunch of overlords who try to ensure everyone has a good experience and
    who ultimately run everything for their own benefit. In that circumstance,
    however, I certainly wouldn’t treat the currency as an investment. I would
    expect the overlords do do all the work and risk of maintaining the value of
    the currency, which would only be possible if they had a steady source of
    revenue from satisfied customers of some actual service they provided. This is
    not something that the Ethereum Foundation does.

[^5]: If the reader is at all familiar with quantum mechanics, this is vaguely
similar to the way that quantum mechanics allows for smooth transitions
between states with different numbers of particles. Physical states can be
superpositions of pure states with different numbers of particles, and the
composition of the physical state can change from something closer to one pure
state to something closer to the other.
