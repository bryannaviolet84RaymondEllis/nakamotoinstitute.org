They gleefully worry that Bitcoin will not make it across the innovation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm">chasm</a> for a variety of reasons:

  The response from the Bitcoin community is to either endlessly argue over the above points<sup><a href="#3" id="ref3" title="Bitcoin has entered its Eternal September, where every person new to Bitcoin thinks they have a unique understanding of Bitcoin and everyone ought to hear about it.

  <li>Bitcoin should continue to be a niche system for the bit-curious, it's just an experiment.</li>

</ul>

<p>
  The above sophisms are each worth their own article, if just to analyze the psycho-social archetypes of the relevant parrots.
</p>

<p>
  The reality, of course, is that some of the criticisms are correct. Bitcoin will not be adopted by the mainstream, it will be <em>forced</em> upon them. <em>Forced</em>, as in "compelled by economic reality". People will be <em>forced</em> to pay with bitcoins, not because of 'the technology', but because no one will accept their worthless fiat for payments. Contrary to popular belief, good money drives out bad. This "driving out" has started as a small fiat bleed. It will rapidly escalate into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding#Classification">Class IV hemorrhaging</a> due to speculative attacks on weak fiat currencies. The end result will be hyperbitcoinization, e.g. "your money is no good here".

<h2>
  Thier's Law: Good Money Drives Out Bad
</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Historically, it has been good, strong currencies that have driven out bad, weak currencies. Over the span of several millennia, strong currencies have dominated and driven out weak in international competition. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_daric">Persian daric</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetradrachm">Greek tetradrachma</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stater">Macedonian stater</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius">Roman denarius</a> did not become dominant currencies of the ancient world because they were "bad" or "weak." The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florins">florins</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducats#Gold_ducat_of_Venice">ducats</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequin_%28coin%29">sequins</a> of the Italian city-states did not become the "dollars of the Middle Ages" because they were bad coins; they were among the best coins ever made. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling#Gold_standard">pound sterling</a> in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_hegemony">dollar</a> in the 20<sup>th</sup> century did not become the dominant currencies of their time because they were weak. Consistency, stability and high quality have been the attributes of great currencies that have won the competition for use as international money.

  Bitcoins are not just good money, they are the best money<sup><a href="#5" id="ref5" title="Bitcoin is the Best Unit of Account by Daniel Krawisz">5</a></sup>. The Bitcoin network has the best monetary policy<sup><a href="#6" id="ref6" title="The Bitcoin Central Bank’s Perfect Monetary Policy by Pierre Rochard">6</a></sup> and the best brand<sup><a href="#7" id="ref7" title="Bitcoin Has No Image Problem by Daniel Krawisz">7</a></sup>. We should therefore expect that bitcoins will drive out bad, weak currencies<sup><a href="#8" id="ref8" title="Hyperbitcoinization by Daniel Krawisz">8</a></sup>. By what process will bitcoins become the dominant currency? Which fiat currencies will the first to disappear? These are the interesting questions of the day, as the necessary premises for these questions are already established truths<sup><a href="#9" id="ref9" title="If you disagree then either you have not been learning or you have not been engaging in the debate, go back to square one.">9</a></sup>.
</p>

<h2>
  1. Fiat Bleed
</h2>

<p>
 Bitcoin's current trend is to increase in value on an exponential trend line as new users arrive in waves. The good money is "slowly" driving out the bad. Two factors drive this:
 <ol>
   <li>Reduction in information asymmetry &ndash; people are learning about Bitcoin and coming to the realization that bitcoins are indeed the best money. Possible overlapping motives:</li>
     <ul>
       <li>ADHD &ndash; compulsive novelty fetichism induced by our post-war consumer culture and/or innate biological processes.</li>
       <li>FOMO &ndash; fear of missing out, see <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regrettheory.asp">Regret Theory</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups">ingroups</a>, aka avarice and status-seeking.</li>
       <li>PISD &ndash; post-internet stress disorder, aka "disruption", "next big thing", "internet of money"</li>
     </ul>
    <li>
      Increasing liquidity &ndash; buying bitcoins is more convenient and has fewer fees attached today than a year ago. One can reasonably predict that this will also be the case a year from now. Why? Because it is profitable. Why? Because people want bitcoins, see above.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  Due to group psychology, these newcomers arrive in waves. The waves have a destabilizing effect on the exchange rate: speculators are unsure of the amplitude or wavelength of adoption, and amateurish punters let their excitement as well as subsequent fear overwhelm them. Regardless, once the tide has pulled back and the weak hands have folded, the price is a few times higher than before the wave. This 'slow' bleed is the current adoption model, and commentators generally assume one of the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Slow bleed never occurred, it's a fiction based on misleading data</li>
    <li>Slow bleed has stopped, the above motives only affect <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lolbertarian">lolbertarians</a> and angry teens</li>
    <li>The process will taper off now, as all the super tech-savvy people are already getting on board</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  My own prediction is that slow bleed is accelerating and only the first step. The second step will be speculative attacks that use bitcoins as a platform. The third and final step will be hyperbitcoinization.
</p>


<h2>
  2. Currency Crises
</h2>

<p>

  Nicholas Plassaras explained the second step perfectly:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    In order to fully appreciate the potential threat Bitcoin poses, it is important to first understand speculative attacks on currencies. A speculative attack on a currency occurs when an investor wishes to take advantage of a “weak currency,” a currency that has depreciated in value relative to other currencies.<sup><a href="#10" id="ref10" title="See Akihiko Matsui, Strong Currency and Weak Currency, 12 J of Japanese and Intl Economies 305, 306–07 (1998).">10</a></sup> The attack begins by taking what is known as a “short position” in the currency. To do this, the attacker borrows a sum of the weak currency and sells it for a stronger (more valuable) currency, with the intention of buying the weak currency back for less than the attacker sold it for.<sup><a href="#11" id="ref11" title="See Tijmen R. Daniëls, Henk Jager, and Franc Klaassen, Defending Against Speculative Attacks *4, (Seventh Bundesbank Spring Conference on Economic Risk Discussion Paper No 2009-011, Feb 2009), online at http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/series/sfb-649-papers/2009-11/PDF/11.pdf (visited Mar 11, 2013).">11</a></sup> If the currency continues to depreciate in value after the short sale, the attacker makes a profit when they buy it back. By way of illustration, the attacker borrows 100 apples and sells them for 80 oranges. If the value of apples-to-oranges gets weaker, the attacker can then sell their 80 oranges back to the market for 120 apples. The attacker then pays back their loan—100 apples—and is left with a 20 apple profit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speculators typically sell the weak currency to commercial banks through long-dated (at least one month) forward contracts.<sup><a href="#11" id="ref11" title="International Monetary Fund Research Department, Capital Flow Sustainability and Speculative Currency Attacks *9, (Dec 1997), online at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1997/12/pdf/imfstaff.pdf (visited Mar 11, 2013).">11</a></sup> These forward contracts, however, pose a problem to the bank if the currency it purchased from the speculator continues to get weaker. Because forward contracts take some time to mature, the bank is forced to hold on to weak currency as it continues to depreciate in value. When it comes time to buy the currency back, the speculator makes a profit at the expense of the bank. By the time the forward contract matures, the bank is forced to buy the weak currency for more than the currency is worth once the contract matures.<sup><a href="#12" id="ref12" title="Id.">12</a></sup> This is known as a “maturity mismatch.” This discrepancy gradually depletes the bank’s supply of the attacked currency over time. By making a profit at the expense of the bank, the attackers have more money to spend in perpetuating the speculative attack, and the banks have less to use in order to guard against it. If banks are unable to offset the speculative attack, the value of the attacked currency spirals uncontrollably downward, triggering destabilization in the foreign currency exchange.<sup><a href="#13" id="ref13" title="Aart Kraay, Do High Interest Rates Defend Against Currencies During Speculative Attacks?, 59 J Intl Econ 297, 298 (2003)">13</a></sup>
  </p>
  <p>
  In order to counteract speculative attacks, banks typically rely on their country’s central bank for assistance. Central banks are public institutions which manage a state’s currency, money supply, and interest rates.<sup><a href="#14" id="ref14" title="See Douglas W. Arner, Michael A. Panton, and Paul Lejot, Central Banks and Central Bank Cooperation in the Global Financial System, 23 Pac McGeorge Global Bus Development L J 1, 12–15 (2010).">14</a></sup> Central banks hold currency reserves which can be loaned out in case of an economic or financial emergency.<sup><a href="#15" id="ref15" title="Id.">15</a></sup> To counter a speculative attack, central banks have a few options. First, they can raise interest rates to deter speculation.<sup><a href="#16" id="ref16" title="Daniëls et al, Defending Against Speculative Attacks at *4 (cited in note133). Raising interest rates raises the forward rate of the forward contract, resulting in a smaller—if not non-existent—profit for the speculator. See id.">16</a></sup>  Second, and more importantly, they can intervene directly into the foreign exchange market by offsetting, or “absorbing,” the maturity losses felt by commercial banks as a result of their forward contracts with investors. This requires the central bank to buy the commercial bank’s excess of the weak currency in exchange for stronger currency at the exchange rate.<sup><a href="#16" id="ref16" title="Id at *7.">16</a></sup> This ensures that commercial banks are not left with only excess amounts of weak currency thanks to their forward contracts with speculators.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order for a central bank to absorb the maturity mismatches of a commercial bank, the central bank must have a reserve of currency upon which to draw. In the event of an emergency, where the central bank does not have a currency reserve, the nation served by the central bank can turn to the IMF for assistance, provided that nation is a member. This is where the importance of the IMF’s quota system comes into play. As discussed in Section III, the quota system allows the IMF to maintain a diverse stockpile of currencies in case they are needed to help stabilize foreign exchange rates.<sup><a href="#17" id="ref17" title="See Part III.B.">17</a></sup> The amount and variety of the currencies available to member nations is limited to the currencies submitted via the quota system.

<p>
    Herein lies the threat posed by Bitcoin. In the event that a wealthy Bitcoin investor—or a number of Bitcoin investors—launch a speculative attack on a currency, what can be done to counter it? In theory, individual countries could diversify their reserve portfolio by purchasing Bitcoins from an online exchange. But if a central bank’s reserve is unable to absorb the maturity mismatches suffered by its central banks, who can it turn to? The IMF has no supply of Bitcoins; indeed it has almost no way to obtain them directly. The IMF obtains currency via the quota system and the IMF can only collect quotas from its members. Bitcoin is neither a member of the IMF, nor could it become one if it wanted to—IMF membership is only open to nation-states.<sup><a href="#18" id="ref18" title="IMF Art II, § 2 (cited in note 8).">18</a></sup> The IMF could try to purchase its own reserve of Bitcoins, but whose money would it use? Which part of the IMF’s general fund would it deplete? In short, Bitcoin’s potential to become a major player in the foreign currency exchange raises a number of substantial questions for the IMF. In its current state, the IMF would be unable to supply the currency needed to counter the destabilizing effect of a speculative attack by Bitcoin users on a member nation’s currency.
  </p>

  <p>
    If nations are deprived of the ability to borrow Bitcoins to offset maturity mismatches, their only reasonable alternative is to rely on the ability to raise interest rates. As explained above, raising domestic interest rates is designed to make speculators’ financing costs higher than their anticipated capital gains in the event of a devaluation, which might force an eventual closing of short positions.<sup><a href="#19" id="ref19" title="International Monetary Fund Research Department, Capital Flow Sustainability at *9 (cited in note 134).">19</a></sup> But raising interest rates can have a number of negative side effects. First, the consequences of higher interest rates depend in large part on the status of the affected economy. If the effected economy is in a period of slow growth, raising interest rates—which, in turn, effectively raises prices—could trigger a recession. As the costs of heightened interest rates mount, confidence in the central bank begins to deteriorate: since increasing interest rates during an economically inopportune time only makes sense if the situation dire, those increases fuel speculation that the nation’s currency is truly weak and only going to get weaker.<sup><a href="#20" id="ref20" title="See Kraay, Do High Interest Rates Defend Against Currencies During Speculative Attacks?at 298(cited in note 135) .">20</a></sup> This leads to vicious spiral: expectations of devaluation force higher interest rates, which in turn imposes greater costs on the economy.<sup><a href="#21" id="ref21" title="Id.">21</a></sup> Given the right—or, rather, wrong—economic climate, those costs may prove too much, causing the nation to spiral into recession and further exacerbating the speculative attack on its currency.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the ability to increase interest rates and the ability to borrow currency from central banks and the IMF work best in conjunction with one another. Without a reserve holding of Bitcoins, the IMF is severely restricted in what it can do to assist member nations facing a speculative attack by Bitcoin users. In effect, the IMF’s inability to contribute leaves nations with only one option: to raise interest rates. And, depending on the state of that nations’ economy, that option may prove economically disastrous.

<p>
  Which countries are most vulnerable to a currency crisis? Business Insider provides a helpful list <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/countries-most-vulnerable-to-crisis-2013-11">here</a>. Bitcoins will have to reach certain threshold of liquidity, indicated by a solid exchange in every financial center and a real money supply &ndash; i.e. market cap &ndash; of at least $50 billion, before they can be used as an instrument in a speculative attack. This will either coincide with or cause a currency crisis.

<h2>
  3. Hyperbitcoinization
</h2>

A speculative attack that seems isolated to one or a few weak currencies, but causes the purchasing power of bitcoins to go up dramatically, will rapidly turn into a contagion. For example, the Swiss will see the price of bitcoins go up ten fold, and then a hundred fold. At the margin they will buy bitcoins simply because they want to speculate on their value, not due to an inherent problem with the Swiss Franc. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_%28social_theory%29">reflexivity</a> here entails that the reduction in demand for Swiss Francs would actually cause higher than expected inflation and thus an inherent problem with the Swiss Franc. The feedback loop between fiat inflation and bitcoin deflation will throw the world into full hyperbitcoinization, explained by Daniel <a href="{{url_for('blogpost', slug='hyperbitcoinization')}}">here</a>.
