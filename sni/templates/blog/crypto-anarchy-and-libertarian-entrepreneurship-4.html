<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Bitcoin naysayers<sup><a href="#1" id="ref1" title="No, seriously, there have been people on the Internet spending a good amount of time writing about a currency they think is going to fail yet continues to succeed beyond anyone's expectations. I get schadenfreude from their lack of schadenfreude. Granted, a few of them are being paid to write controversial click bait and/or just trolling - both activities that I respect and understand.">1</a></sup> wring their hands over how Bitcoin can possibly become mainstream. They gleefully worry that Bitcoin will not make it across the innovation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm">chasm</a> for a variety of reasons:
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It's too complicated</li>
    <li>The security is too hard to get right</li>
    <li>Existing and upcoming fiat payment systems are or will be superior</li>
    <li>It's too volatile</li>
    <li>The government will ban it</li>
  </ol>
<p>
  The response from the Bitcoin community is to either endlessly argue over the above points<sup><a href="#2" id="ref2" title="Bitcoin has entered its Eternal September, where every person new to Bitcoin thinks they have a unique understanding of Bitcoin and everyone ought to hear about it. There's an endless flood of newbies 'concerned' about such and such 'problem' with Bitcoin. The Bitcoin community does these carpetbaggers a real disservice by taking them seriously instead of just telling them 'read more'.">2</a></sup> or to find their inner Bitcoin Jonah<a href="#3" id="ref3" title="The opposite of Bitcoin Jesus - a defeatist, self-sabotaging, and timid little man on a quest to confirm Bitcoin's weakness.">3</a></sup> with platitudes like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>It's not Bitcoin the currency that I care about, it's Bitcoin the technology.</li>
  <li>It would be better if the block chain technology were used by banks and governments.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin should continue to be a niche system for the bit-curious, it's just an experiment.</li>
  <li>Fiat and Bitcoin will live side-by-side, happily everafter.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin is the Myspace 
</ul>

<p>
  The above sophisms are each worth their own article, if just to analyze the psycho-social archetypes of the relevant parrots.

<h2>
  Thier's Law
</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Historically, it has been good, strong currencies that have driven out bad, weak currencies. Over the span of several millennia, strong currencies have dominated and driven out weak in international competition. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_daric">Persian daric</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetradrachm">Greek tetradrachma</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stater">Macedonian stater</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius">Roman denarius</a> did not become dominant currencies of the ancient world because they were "bad" or "weak." The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florins">florins</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducats#Gold_ducat_of_Venice">ducats</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequin_%28coin%29">sequins</a> of the Italian city-states did not become the "dollars of the Middle Ages" because they were bad coins; they were among the best coins ever made. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling#Gold_standard">pound sterling</a> in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_hegemony">dollar</a> in the 20<sup>th</sup> century did not become the dominant currencies of their time because they were weak. Consistency, stability and high quality have been the attributes of great currencies that have won the competition for use as international money.

<p>
  Bitcoins are not just good money, they are the best money<sup><a href="#4" id="ref4" title="Bitcoin is the Best Unit of Account by Daniel Krawisz">4</a></sup>. The Bitcoin network has the best monetary policy<sup><a href="#5" id="ref5" title="The Bitcoin Central Bankâ€™s Perfect Monetary Policy by Pierre Rochard">5</a></sup> and the best brand<sup><a href="#6" id="ref6" title="Bitcoin Has No Image Problem by Daniel Krawisz">6</a></sup>. We should therefore expect that bitcoins will drive out bad, weak currencies<sup><a href="#7" id="ref7" title="Hyperbitcoinization by Daniel Krawisz">7</a></sup>. By what socio-economic mechanism will bitcoins become the dominant currency? Which fiat currencies will the first to disappear? These are the interesting questions of the day, as the necessary premises for these questions are already established truths<sup><a href="#" id="ref" title="If you disagree then either you have not been learning or you have not been engaging in the debate, go back to square one.">4</a></sup>.

<h2>
  Fiat Bleed, Garden-variety Bitcoinization
</h2>
<p>
 Bitcoins' current trend is to increase in value on an exponential trend line as new users arrive in waves. Two factors drive this:
 <ol>
   <li>Reduction in information asymmetry - people are learning about Bitcoin and coming to the realization that bitcoins are indeed the best money. Possible overlapping motives:</li>
     <ul>
       <li>ADHD - compulsive novelty fetichism encouraged by our post-war consumer culture.</li>
       <li>FOMO - fear of missing out, see <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regrettheory.asp">Regret Theory</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups">ingroups</a>, aka greed for money and social status.</li>
       <li>PISD - post-internet stress disorder, aka "disruption", "next big thing", "internet of money"</li>
     </ul>
    <li>
      Increasing liquidity - it is much less expensive and much more convenient to buy bitcoins today than a year ago. One can reasonably predict that this will also be the case a year from now. Why? Because it is profitable. Why? Because people want bitcoins, see above.
    </li>
  </ol>
