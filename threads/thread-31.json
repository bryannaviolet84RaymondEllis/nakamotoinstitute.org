The ones presented now are practical. They're also credible as the early warning turned out to be true: Bitcoin has transformed into a ridiculously volatile speculation and hoarding tool rather than a stable medium of exchange.</i><br/><br/><a href=\"http://postimage.org/image/2zivvoft0/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"userimg\" src=\"https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fs3.postimage.org%2F2zivvoft0%2Fchart.jpg&amp;t=589&amp;c=9dNTJ61BQzoxTw\"/></a><br/><br/>I dare not spend a coin today lest its price doubles tomorrow, nor dare I receive a payment in coins today lest their price crashes before I rush to sell them, nor dare I, naturally, store my wealth in the form coins so I'm relying on vulnerable exchangers to store it in the form of fiat currency. Something must be very wrong...<br/><br/>Yet that was all but unexpected; it was inevitable given how the limited supply system was designed. Let's stop and think about this for a minute:<br/><br/>Satoshi stated in his FAQ that <i>When Bitcoins start having real exchange value, the competition for coin creation will drive the price of electricity needed for generating a coin close to the value of the coin</i>. Now the only problem is that this \"real exchange value\" itself would be determined in part by electricity, computer deterioration, and time expenditures needed to generate new BTCs. And those expenditures increase with time. We have a loop.<br/><br/><b>Every four years a miner needs to exert double the virtual effort to create the same amount of coins</b>, which means he'll be constantly demanding higher prices to compensate for his costs. Which also means that bitcoins won't generally be spendable. Why? Because only an idiot spends a currency which he is certain its price will double within 4 years, effectively granting him about <b>19% real annual interest</b>--significantly better than any bank or mutual fund.<br/><br/><i>Great!</i> I hear you say, <i>free money for everyone, right?</i><br/><br/>Wrong. <br/><br/>Just as it's futile to create and distribute free extra coins to anyone already owning them \"to make everyone richer\", built-in deflation won't be helping anyone on the long term. That free money will encourage people to <b>hoard BTCs forever</b> or until another wishful investor buys them, fueling <b>speculation and price bubbles</b>. Bitcoin will ultimately be regarded as a phony <i>investment</i> with no real value, just like the good ol' <b>Pyramid (Ponzi) Scheme</b> where everyone purchases a ticket just to sell it to someone else later for a high profit until <b>the whole system collapses when it runs out of new victims</b>.<br/><br/><b>This scenario can only be avoided if the cost of generating new BTCs got constant</b>. Which can only happen if participating nodes needed to exert a more or less constant amount of work (cost) to generate a given amount of BTCs. Only then will people be inclined to actually spend their coins, and they can finally serve their purpose as a stable medium of exchange.<br/><br/>But that's not it. The very fact that the <b>newly-generated coin supply dwindles as its user base (hopefully) continues to grow will raise that 19% deflation rate even higher</b>. Let alone that many coins are forever destroyed via HDD failures and lost thumb drives, pushing the deflation even higher and higher. <b>High deflation is bad because nobody spends their money, they only save it because it gains value over time</b>. Can you imagine what would've happened if, say, the Japanese government hasn't printed any (or very few) Yens during the last century while the population exploded? One 1911 Yen would have been more than enough to buy a house today. Who then would've spent their Yens in 1911? Why, almost noone of course! <b>This scenario is only avoidable if the number of available BTCs continues to grow with its user base at least proportionally.</b> If both figures match, <b>we won't have deflation nor inflation</b>.<br/><br/>But under the current model the price wouldn't necessarily be tied to the increasing generating electricity costs forever, which means there's a different scenario other than a perpetually deflating currency, and it's much worse: After about 14 years almost no new coins will be produced. Generating costs could then be largely irrelevant, resulting in a <b>lack of a price anchor</b>. This would leave the price solely to the market's supply and demand forces. <b>Just like Picasso paintings</b>, a coin could then be worth $1 on a given day then literally be worth $100 on the next and vice versa.<br/><br/>So what's the solution? Well, as you might have already guessed, <b>we should remove both the 4-years doubling interval rule and the 21M limit. Just allow BTCs to be generated indefinitely</b>.<br/><br/>Don't sigh in relief just yet. After removing the limit we're better off but <b>still have another issue: The number of users and generating nodes grows exponentially while the existing coins grow arithmetically</b>. We therefore need a mechanism to reflect the number of generating nodes (i.e the total exerted effort) into the resulting bitcoins. But blocks aren't the answer: Technical difficulties have been addressed against my original suggestion which advised rendering the amount of generatable blocks unlimited and totally dependent on the number of nodes. The problem was that a minimum \"cooling down\" period is needed to propagate who owns the new block across the entire network to avoid conflicts.<br/><br/><b>My modified suggestion therefore is to reflect the total exerted effort in the number of coins</b>, not blocks. So we'd still have only 144 new daily blocks, but the amount of coins in these new blocks will depend on the proof-of-work difficulty (which automatically adjusts to the number of generating nodes). That makes sense. <b>A late adopter who needs to spend weeks, months, or even years to generate a block should end up with more coins in that block than an early adopter who had to spend only a couple of hours.</b><br/><br/>And no, sorry, early adopters didn't take any risk to deserve a reward. Running a computer program which pops deflationary money isn't a risky activity, not one that warrants a 1,000,000% profit anyway. <b>No wonder Satoshi (not his real name, which is unknown) was fiercely defending the original design</b> and wanted to keep it going for as long as possible. It allowed him to initially produce all 144 daily blocks (7200 coins/day) for quite a while before having competing miners drive his coins' price way up. He's probably following up on this forum from his Caribbean beach seat now, with other \"early adopters\" eager to join him. The proposed system is the way to halt this pyramid scheme.<br/><br/><b>The coins' price will then depend on the total cost of electricity sacrificed to generate the newest block</b>. Think of it as if everyone in the network bought some electricity from their utilities company before loading it all onto the network where the roulette runs every ten minutes on average with one lucky winner hitting the jackpot. <b>Bitcoins would have a real value equal to the amount of electricity sacrificed to create them, and their price would essentially be a function of the (pretty stable) average worldwide home electricity costs</b>, not a function of the number of generating nodes nor total demand, which will never stabilize in the foreseeable future. <b>Under the proposed system, if the number of generating users doubles tomorrow, the number of coins generated tomorrow will double as well, offsetting the demand surge with a supply surge without the need for a price jump followed by price crash as is the case now</b>.<br/><br/>This flexible supply system will be telling everyone <b>there's no advantage to being an early adopter</b>. A user doesn't need another victim to reap rewards later because there are no rewards to begin with. <b>Bitcoin is a medium of exchange, not a profit-making tool</b>. Speculators and investors can go ruin another currency for there's nothing for them to gain here until they can manipulate global electricity prices. By <b>eliminating risk and uncertainty</b> we're showing them the door, thus accomplishing the most important task towards achieving a stable medium of exchange the general population can trust.<br/><br/>Finally, a simple numerical example: If we assume the average worldwide cost of running a modern CPU for 24 hours is 20 cents, and if our initial goal is to have one BTC roughly equaling one US dollar, then the amount of coins each new block contains should equal: (fifth of a BTC/144 * the estimated equivalent of the modern CPUs number in the network). Thus, if the exerted power was then estimated to equal 10,000 CPUs, the new block created at that point would contain 14 BTC because the whole network spent $14 during the last 10 minutes to create it. If it was 20,000 CPUs, the new block would have 28 BTC and so on. <b>Once enough coins are produced for \u0e3f1 equaling $1, miners would generate just enough to cover the economy's expansion</b> because any excess will come to them at a loss. The price would then fluctuate approximately along the lines of 99\u00a2-$1.03.<br/><br/>Practically speaking, if the price of 1 BTC after implementing the new system was, say $10, we could simply add a zero to increase the amount of existing coins ten-fold, making 1 BTC equaling 1 dollar, after which <b>the price will essentially stabilize itself automatically forever</b>. Note that the estimated CPUs figure is arbitrarily set using current computer power and running costs. Errors won't be detrimental because the market will correct itself resulting in 1 BTC equaling slightly more or less than $1. For example, if computers became more energy-efficient while electricity costs stayed constant, then \u0e3f1 will equal a bit less than $1 because it now costs less to produce and vice versa. Whatever the case may be, the price would be stable on the short term and move slowly along with electricity costs and CPU/GPU efficiency on the long term, rendering coins as stable as major fiat currencies.<br/><br/><i>Note that some replies before page 7 might seem irrelevant because of the suggestion improvements addressing them.

They are obsolete and no longer relevant as the post is now heavily edited. Nevertheless I thought I'd include them for anyone who wishes to understand the full context of the 2010 discussion (up to page 7).<br/><br/><i>So what's the solution? Well, as you might have already guessed, we should remove both the 4-years interval thing and the 21M limit. Just let BTCs continue to be created forever at a constant rate*. The rate should be divisible enough to give up to, say, 100,000 people an incentive to run the network simultaneously. In other words, the current 144 daily blocks (or units) aren't enough because this means that @ 100,000 users, one has to wait an average of 757.6 days (that's 2+ years) to see something pop up on his screen. 100k is an arbitrary figure, but remember that we need to mobilize as many nodes as possible to resist the tampering attempts of supercomputer-owning governments who can and will try to generate their own proof of work to ruin the project if it ever reaches mainstream. Also note that this will not lead to inflation in the foreseeable future, because the user base of bitcoin will continue to grow for years to come, let alone natural economic and population growth (unless the Mayans turn out to be right, of course).<br/><br/>This way, when the number of bitcoin-generating nodes approaches stability, we will end up with a slowly-growing number of bitcoins matching a slowly-growing number of nodes, resulting in the currency's relative price stability, leading in turn to the ultimate goal of it being used for exchange purposes.<br/><br/>Now for the fun part, a numerical example: If the system is producing 10k bitcoins/day at a constant rate (with difficulty adjusted by collective CPU power just like it is now), and the number of users attempting to generate BTCs was 10k after 1,000 days from now, and increasing at a constant rate of 10 new users/day, we will have and continue to have an average of 1,000 BTCs/user. No inflation, no deflation, no incentive to hoard BTCs, and no incentive to spend BTCs quickly (though that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing!). Remember that we can always add or remove zero's if the numbers turned out to be awkward at some point, like Germany did in the 1920's hyper-inflation. Note that under this model, an initial price surge is inevitable because the number of nodes increases at abnormal rates at the project's beginning. As the project matures, there would be only reasonable user-base increases, so the price won't fluctuate much any longer (think the percentage increase in newly opened email accounts from 2000 to 2001 vs from 2020 to 2021, for example).<br/><br/>*Another idea would be to set the BTCs creation's difficulty irrelevant of total CPU power in the network so that, say, the average computer would create 1 BTC/day. The global price would then automatically adjust to the participants' average electricity and machine consumption cost. It would be sort of like buying some electricity from the utilities company and loading it on your machine as transferable BTCs. If electricity happens to be cheapest in India, Indians will initially profit from creating BTCs, but as their proportion among the nodes increases, the BTCs price will decrease as it approaches India's average electricity cost. Exchangers will quickly balance supply and demand just as in ForEx fluctuations, Econ 101, remember? Non-Indians would purchase BTCs from Indian exchangers at a very small profit margin because of competition. I personally prefer this model to the constant rate one because the amount of BTCs in circulation would generally be proportionate to the amount of users (sort of like farming gold in MMORPGs), instead of picking an arbitrary constant figure and letting users adjust to it. Thus this model avoids the initial price surge because there will be a balance from day one.<br/><br/>Admittedly, BTCs' price would be tied to energy's under this model. But then again, this is also the case in both my other and the current model. Besides, using Bitcoin for casual quick transfers (rather than as savings) would virtually eliminate this risk. Also granted that creating zillions of BTCs (eg. via governmental sabotage) would lead to inflation in this case if they flood the market with cheap coins, but then again this problem exists in the other two models as well, and can also be avoided by those using the coin for transfers only. But whereas in the other two models a supercomputer-or-two can ruin the whole project by barring most of the honest nodes from creating coins (via controlling most of the CPU power and skyrocketing coin-generating needed effort), under this uber-flexible model everybody will be able to create some coins and use them for transfers regardless of sabotage attempts.</i></div>",

Every model adjusts to supply and demand, they just adjust in different ways.<br/><br/>The current model is beneficial to early adopters in three different ways. First, early adopters generate more bitcoins while there is less competition at the beginning. Second, the availability of bitcoins decreases, which cements their position of wealth. Last, the early adopters have the potential to get rich off the latecomers once generating blocks becomes extremely difficult. Latecomers will have to inject dollars or something else of worth in order to get access to bitcoins and the wealth will go disproportionately to the early adopters.<br/><br/>The idea of the swarm increasing the amount of bitcoins awarded as processing power increases is interesting, but I think it would give too much advantage to botnets. With a constant amount of bitcoins being generated, they can only collect a days worth of bitcoins per day, but if the number of bitcoins was variable, they could swoop in and generate a thousand years worth of bitcoins in a few weeks.<br/><br/>In my ideal model, the same amount of blocks would be generated per day, but 100 bitcoins with no decimal would be awarded for generating a block instead of 50.00 and the amount of bitcoins awarded per block would stay the same forever instead of halving every four years. This would give one advantage to the early adopters who would be able to generate bitcoins more easily while there is less competition at the beginning and it would allow deflation as more people adopt bitcoins, but it would also allow for inflation as more bitcoins are generated, thus encouraging people to spend their bitcoins. Eventually creating bitcoins will still become very difficult and dollars or something else of worth will have to be injected in order for latecomers to get access to bitcoins, but as time passes, that wealth will be distributed more and more evenly between early adopters and latecomers. I prefer 100 to 50.00 because bitcoins are going to take a while before they are worth enough to need to be more divisible and because it's not clear whether a single bitcoin is \u0e3f1.00 or \u0e3f0.01.</div>",

Things were valued for how much gold they were worth, not vice versa. We should think of bitcoin today as a new unestablished currency in a world of established alternatives (eg. the Euro 10 years ago). Additionally, if we assume that it became impossible to mine virtually anymore gold today, and we further assume that the demand for gold was perpetually on the rise (for example because women were increasingly using it for jewelery), then yes, it will result in a perpetual deflation for its value and nobody would be willing to sell their gold except for emergencies. Under these conditions, using gold as a means of payment is a sure way for starting a depression!<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.msg398#msg398\">Quote from: sirius-m on February 18, 2010, 01:31:50 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">It's an old keynesian argument that deflation is bad because it leads to a \"deflationary spiral\" where nobody eventually buys anything, because they can get more the next day. <br/></div>Old and true <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/><br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.msg398#msg398\">Quote from: sirius-m on February 18, 2010, 01:31:50 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">That didn't happen where gold standard was applied. <br/></div>What has gold standard got with increasing the value of BTCs over time?

At some point (after about 15 years) there will be more and more people demanding coins while almost none is generated.

And you know what? Maybe that happened to gold in the beginning of its discovery, until almost all people on the planet had gold available to them if they had a reasonable equivalent (e.g. In Arabia, more than a thousand years ago, you could have sold a camel at a time for about 70 gold dinars, and a rabbit for tenth of a gold dinar.

Even if human population was shrinking by, say 1% annually now, I assure you that Internet users population will be increasing and bitcoin users will be increasing at an even higher rate. \"Bitcoin users\" is the magic word here. With the suggested variable model, we're always sure that new coin generation matches the expanding (or shrinking) user base. But anyway, I see that you're beginning to side with me that the 4-year-doubling isn't a good idea.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.msg405#msg405\">Quote from: NewLibertyStandard on February 19, 2010, 06:26:18 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">If the TV buyer is an early adopter and the TV seller is a latecomer, then the TV buyer already has many bitcoins and it would cost the TV seller more dollars worth of electricity than the price of the TV to generate 1 bitcoin. <br/></div>Man, if you paid $1,000 for an ounce of gold, then a few months later it was worth $2,000, are you going to sell it for $1,000?! No? Good. Because the early adopter will not treat his coins as if they're worth the pennies he paid for them anymore now that they're worth a ton of electricity.

People do value potential future increases, but they also value having an item now. Why would someone borrow money on a credit card with a 19% interest rate instead of keeping their money in their savings account? They do it because they value having the TV now more than the potential losses over time. Life is short. You're welcome to save all your high returning money until the day you die, but the rest of us are going to make use of it before it's no use to us.<br/></div>My answer is simple: Assuming people approve the current Bitcoin's model, it will turn out to be the #1 worldwide investment: Just buy (or hack) a bunch of PCs, let them run, and you'll be earning at least 19% annually with no risk involved! Investors (and indeed, botnets) won't leave a chance for normal folks like you and me to earn any BTCs much less spend them. Any bitcoin will be spent 2-3 times at most before falling into the hands (well, \"the computers\" is the better term here) of an investor who'll keep it for a very long time or forever. This model has to change or it will destroy the otherwise excellent idea. Making bitcoin a way to INVEST rather than to SPEND is its one-way ticket to failure. You also forgot that bitcoins will leave the stream all the time (eg. computer failures or accidental deletion), which will add to their deflating. Might as well turn this 19% into 20% or something.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.msg406#msg406\">Quote from: NewLibertyStandard on February 19, 2010, 06:48:30 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">My exchange rate will only increase as Bitcoin becomes more popular. There are practical limits to the popularity of Bitcoin. Sure, potentially it could be run on every functional computer around the world, but from practical perspective, that will never happen. The swarm is currently pretty small, so when a few new users join, there is a large effect on my exchange rate and it increases fairly quickly. As the rate of growth slows or reverses and as my exchange rate average increases over the next two years, the exchange rate will steady out with only very small increases AND decreases every day. <br/></div>Even if we assume that Bitcoin's current users will never increase (thus not making it more difficult to generate coins), we're sure that its value will increase by at least 19% annually because of the expected 4-year-old D-day when which all BTCs price magically doubles because it will cost double to generate them.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.msg406#msg406\">Quote from: NewLibertyStandard on February 19, 2010, 06:48:30 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">As for the impending doom and gloom you're prophesying will accompany the decreased payout in a few years, all I have to do is add a little multiply by two to my exchange rate calculation and the problem is solved.
