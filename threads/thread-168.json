        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Hi bitcoin users<br/><br/>I found bitcoin yesterday, and I am really impressed by the idea of avoiding issuers/banks in a digital cash system.<br/><br/>However, I have one objection that I would like your view on.<br/><br/>That is the latency, or delay in a local transaction. Let us say that a payer and payee are located in the same city for example. I will claim, that they want a payment to go through<br/>with a delay not much slower than the latency of network connections. With an issuer and using local coins (a prefix, say, can be used to localize a server of the issuer), the transaction should be done and verified in 100 microseconds or less. With a global p2p network, it is necessary to have all nodes receive the transaction, do some calculations and send results back.<br/>It is not feasible,\u00a0 with the speed of light as an upper limit, to do this faster than a second. As I understand it you actually use something like 10 minutes for one block, or even more for several block verifications. This means that verification of the absence of double spending is 10,000 or even tens of millions times too slow. This would get even worse in interplanetary trade of course.<br/><br/>The ideal payment system should be decentralized but also local, i.e., the verification of a local transaction must not have to wait for a light signal to travel to the other end of the \"universe\" and come back again. <br/><br/>Locality, in the sense describe here, is crucial, I will claim.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Morten Krogh.</div>",

If you are using the entire public network, then yes you are depending on that time for the data to be processed by everyone else that is running a node. But, you don't have to do it that way. You can build a trusted node (like a server) and have your clients direct connect to it and let it do the fast verification for you.<br/><br/>It won't net you 20 confirmations in a few milliseconds, but it will help stop double-spending as long as you remain in control of that node because it knows what is being spent. The whole double-spending issue arises from trust. When you are comparing anonymous seller to anonymous buyer, the only \"middle man\" for trust is the entire swarm (hence confirmations that neither is cheating)<br/><br/>If you know you can trust your own node(s), then it reduces the likely-hood that double-spending will occur within your own trusted network. So if your example applied to an ATM like card for example, the bank (or whoever) would have all of those ATM machines networked to their own private node (or server) which would then further connect to the outside (Internet) for the rest of the transactions. So if you went to an ATM, withdrew 100 BTC (say the entire account only had that much), then moments later went to another ATM elsewhere and tried to withdraw that amount again, somewhere along that trusted chain would spot a double-spend attempt and basically report back no BTC left for that address.<br/><br/>The whole verification process is how you put the swarm to work, all those clients are examining if your transaction was valid or not, but you don't have to wait for them to transfer the coin around. You can spend the coin around in circles all day without a single transaction verification. It's only when double-spending occurs does the network correct for itself and fix the balances.<br/><br/>Banks already have this exact same problem. They all have their own networks that connect to other bank networks and it's just as easy to double-spend on their ATM as has been demonstrated at black-hat hacker conventions for probably 10+ years now. I remember reading about the issue back in 1997 because a lot of networks will still on dial-up then for banks and the latency issue was part of the attack because everyone had their own *database* that all had to inter-connect.<br/><br/>With bitcoin, everyone is the database and banker and guard at the same time, so while it's not perfect, it's actually a lot better than what banks are using. Have you ever noticed at an ATM they have about 20 \"network\" stickers for all the different banks and setups that the ATM has to be compatible with?</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">FreeMoney, I think it is crucial to have fast local transactions. It is needed for many businesses and person to person payments.<br/>10 minutes or even 10 seconds is too slow. An extraterrestrial system was just an extreme example. <br/><br/>The most pressing problem, as I see it, is to get a digital cash system that makes it possible for people and small businesses to pay each other fast and without <br/>registration and supervision from a big company/government.<br/><br/>I read the thread about vending machines. There were no real solutions except companies that would monitor for double checking in a few seconds. I agree that would be possible, <br/>but we would lose the whole point of not having an issuer. This company needs to be trusted, it will break anonymity, and people need an account with that company.<br/><br/>What is wrong with the follwing \"standard\" system. A central bank/government issues a currency like today. It sets up servers around the world to validate transactions.<br/>People pay each other by means of a single verification with one of the centeal bank's servers. The speed issue is solved by coins having the location of the relevant server embedded in them. In worst case, the server would need to make long round trips to other severs, but in most cases the first server would know the answer already. The cental bank could have an algorithm for distributing coins around the network to optimise latency and server load. The wallet would have an algorithm for choosing the most local coins when making a payment. <br/>The wallet could also prepare by exchanging coins with the server. On your way to Europe, the wallet replaces \"American coins\" with European coins, such that payments will be fast in Europe. For the user, this is incredibly easy. It is anonymous, and it requires no agreements with any processing companies.<br/>Also, there could be many issuers of the same currency if so desired.<br/><br/>Bitcoin gets rid of the issuers, but instead introduces unacceptable slowness or a lot of middlemen like credit card companies/debit accounts etc. Satoshi's solution, on the vending machine thread, with a double spending checking company is still too slow, even though faster than a block, and this company needs an omnipresence on the network almost like <br/>an issuer. <br/><br/>But discarding speed, bitcoin seems extremely elegant. And of course there are uses for this kind of system. One could imagine many local bitcoin systems with an exchange between <br/>different currencies. That would work except that an attacker can take over a small currency.</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">mkrogh: Yes, you are correct. <br/><br/>There is absolutely no requirement for there to be such latency in the bitcoin system. Nothing fundamental would change if the system were implemented with a block list that updated every 10 seconds, instead of every 10 minutes. It was just a design decision that could be changed without effecting monetary policy a bit.<br/><br/>In fact, there is no requirement their be a block list that updates in increments at all. The system would work fine if each transaction were validated one-by-one. In effect one transaction per block. That was a design decision to make networked consensus building easier.<br/><br/>However, when you say \"local transaction validation\" what you are grasping for is a truly distributed system, rather than a monolithic system made redundant. The current version of bitcoin is the latter. Each node does exactly the same work as every other node. Each redundantly checking every transaction. It is a system horribly wasteful of resources. And because it is so wasteful, generates latency as a waste product.<br/><br/>Bitcoin could be made into a truly distributed system by storing the transaction graph in a distributed hash table. This is the kind of magic that is behind most other P2P systems. In effect, each bitcoin address would be arbitrarily mapped to a smaller set of nodes that checked its transactions. In such a system, there is no need to broadcast global state to every machine. This takes huge amount of latency out without needing to change any of the desired behavior.<br/></div>",

By fast payments, I mean payments that are completely validated in a time frame that does not depend on the total size of the coin system. In other words local trade should be possible, even if the digital cash system is used all over the world (or galaxy). The preparation before arrival is important here. Of course, many coins can not be verified, fast, against double spending by the payee, but there should exist some coins that can, given the location.

The coins have a tag that denotes where double spending will be verified. The issuer keeps the information about those coins on their servers in that location. In other words, the issuer's distributed hash table follows some rules for what coins are stored where.

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">What I'm suggesting doesn't exist yet. There was related talk about similar issues on the thermodynamic perversity of generating blocks. If I have just one central node, the system could generate a transaction block in a fraction of a second. If you wanted, it could do this only once every ten minutes. But it wouldn't need any more than a fraction of a second of CPU time on a single processor.<br/><br/>The reason is purely related to consensus. <br/><br/>So if you had two nodes, you could have them both redundantly capture all transactions, and then in a fraction of a second each could generate a block. They could then exchange block hashes and if they matched, they would have consensus. If they didn't match you could reach consensus in one of two ways. 1) compare the transactions of each block one by one, and create a block consisting of the union of all transactions. or 2) Just pick one of the blocks and go with it. The second is what bitcoin actually does now. <br/><br/>It just picks using the worlds most expensive coin flipper. You could accomplish the same task with a much cheaper coin flipper and nothing in bitcoin would change one bit.<br/><br/>That is what I mean by \"design decision\" a it doesn't change any of the requirements for the system's features or behavior. It just implements things differently.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>So when I talk about distributing the transaction graph throughout a distributed hash table it is just a different possible (but currently non-coded) way of implementing bitcoin's key feature. The feature of verifying the transfer of bitcoins from one address to another, in a way that makes it impossible to double spend coins.<br/><br/>Optimally, if you had x,000 transactions per minute and 100 nodes, each node would only have to do 1/100th of the work of a single node handling x,000 transactions per minute. Each transaction is only required to be recorded once.<br/><br/>However, with the current bitcoin implementation, if you have 100 nodes, they all run at 100% cpu for x,000 transactions. If you add another 100 nodes, they all still run at 100% cpu but do exactly the same job. We used to call it \"government work\" when you could do a job with 5 guys, but instead they used 50 guys, because more people working is better for the economy!<br/><br/>So the new design constraint I'm proposing, is that for a given number of nodes (n), it should take (Order (1/n)) or maybe (Order log(n)) work per cpu to handle a given number of transactions. In this case work means CPU time and network communication. My design modifications FAIL if they give up any of the transaction protections of the existing system.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>It turns out that the block list itself is not required to validate transactions. Only the transactions are required. So to understand what I'm suggesting you have to think about an equivalent bitcoin implementation without a monolithic block list containing every transaction in the history of the system.<br/><br/>Instead, the transactions are redundantly scattered across all the nodes. No node need keep a complete list off all transactions, but they must be able to quickly retrieve any transaction on demand. Optimally in Order(1) time, but Order(log(n) time would probably suffice. That reduces the storage requirements of any given node to Order(1/n).<br/><br/>Transactions are mapped to nodes by transaction out-points. You generate two unique out-point identifiers by hashing the transaction+out-point information. You then store the transaction redundantly on the five \"closest nodes\" to each out-point ID. That means for a system with 10,000 nodes. Each transaction is stored with 10X redundancy instead of 10,000X redundancy. (the 10X was an arbitrary choice, the redundancy would be based upon the DHT algorithm and characteristics of the node population.)<br/><br/>Now each of those 10 nodes holds that out-point data completely privately, unless another node can show a \"need to know\". In this case a need to know is demonstrated by submitting a signed transaction that includes a given out-point as an in-point. In this case the storage node stores the new transaction. It also returns any known transactions referencing that out-point. If there is a previous transaction in-point associated with the out-point the second transaction is a double spend.<br/><br/>So for any new transaction, to verify it, you send it to the five closest nodes to each in-point on the transaction. They record the transaction and immediately tell you if they've seen a double spend. If any have, it's a bogus transaction, which gets broadcast to the other close nodes.<br/><br/>Now the what I'm suggesting also increases anonymity because you no longer have to broadcast every transaction you make to the world. Also random individuals can't go poking around in your business.<br/><br/>There are many ways to map bitcoin transactions to DHTs. I just chose an example that would be easy to explain. There may be other possibilities offer improvement. But this one is sufficient to get the point across.<br/><br/>There is also a fun technology called a \"dining cryptographers network\" that could further improve some of the anonymity aspects of bitcoin.<br/><br/><br/></div>",

The only way there can be disagreement is conflicting transactions got broadcast simultaneously but one arrived a close node A first and the conflicting one arrived at close node E first. By the end of the two 5 node broadcasts, both parties would discover the double spend.<br/><br/>So which one is valid? Who cares. Flip a coin. That is exactly what bitcoin does in this situation. If my node is working on a block with on transaction, and your node is working on a block with a conflicting transaction, whoever solves the block first wins. Distributed coin flipping algorithms are trivial. All of this can be done almost immediately. Much faster than in 10 minute windows. So no, the majority doesn't change if 4 nodes leave, because consensus was reached and the nodes were made consistent.<br/><br/>By the way, standard DHTs already address preserving data when nodes leave, and spreading the data when nodes join.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=723.msg8013#msg8013\">Quote from: gavinandresen on August 06, 2010, 11:32:05 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">And if I know that I'm going to create a large transaction, can I do some work precomputing node IDs such that the transaction (which I haven't yet sent out) will hash to nodes that I control?\u00a0 \u00a0If I control all the nodes storing the transaction, then I can just answer \"yes, absolutely, that transaction is valid and hasn't been double-spent...\"<br/></div><br/>No, this would be a requirement constraint. It is possible for the same reason that it is impossible to generate two public keys that match to the same bitcoin address. See my previous faux pas.<br/><br/>Nodes would generate node addresses based upon private keys, exactly as is being done for bitcoin addresses. This makes node spoofing implausible. All of the inputs to the out-point hash are fixed except the payee, which is pre-specified. The only flexibility I can think of would be in the payment amount.

It maintains relative order among transactions. It arbitrarily reaches consensus on conflicts. Neither method has a requirement to accurately order unrelated transactions by time.

Just as is being done with the current implementation. Perhaps I chose a poor way to create a node ID. Freenet proposes an entirely different way of shared generation of node IDs. It doesn't suffer from the issues you point out. Perhaps it has other issues in this situation.
