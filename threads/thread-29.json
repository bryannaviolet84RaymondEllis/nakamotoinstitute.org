        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Hello,<br/><br/>well the title says it all. I want to set up multiple bitcoin machines behind NAT.<br/>For this it reason would be nice, if one could choose an other port than 8333, which I guess would have other nice side effects. Maybe someone uses this port for something else or maybe it isn't possible to set up port forwarding to this port for one reason or another.<br/><br/>Or is there an other way one should go?<br/><br/>Greetings,<br/>foobar</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Right now there isn't a port number setting to do that. \u00a0It's a feature yet to be implemented. \u00a0You can only set up your NAT to port-forward to one of the computers. \u00a0(I said something earlier about NAT port translation, but that wouldn't work, other nodes wouldn't know to connect to that port)<br/><br/>If you want, as a small optimization, you could run the rest of your computers as:<br/>bitcoin -connect=&lt;the IP of the first computer&gt;<br/><br/>so they get all their network communication from the first computer and don't all connect over the net individually for the same information. \u00a0This saves bandwidth, although it doesn't use much bandwidth to begin with, so it wouldn't really matter unless you had tons of computers.<br/><br/>For redundancy in case the first computer goes down, you could have two that connect out and the rest connect to both of them. \u00a0The first two are run normally, the rest are run like:<br/>bitcoin -connect=&lt;IP1&gt; -connect=&lt;IP2&gt;</div>",
