        "content": "<div class=\"post\">This is Operation Economic Growth. Our mission is to grow the bitcoin economy by making everyone specialize in a narrow range of good and services.<br/><br/>Simply put, announce what you want to consume and I'll add it to the list. Somebody then will announce that he will try to enter that niche. There can be competition within niches too, but there are other niches to fill.<br/><br/>We'll hold those people \"accountable\" for their niches by plodding, encouraging, starting a thread and then getting disappointed when the service didn't come online etc. <br/><br/>Wanted Niches:<br/><br/>1. craigslist like classified ads for locale.<br/><br/>2. \"Mechanical Turk\"-like site that list simple jobs for people to do. Suggested by noagendamarket in the Stable Exchange Rate? topic of the Economic forum.<br/><br/>3. Beer supply store. Malt, yeasts, hops, etc.<br/><br/>4. Plant store for selling various herbs and stuff.<br/><br/>6. Hacker Academy. Free educational video. Flat tutiion fee classes. Pay as you go for personal tutors.<br/><br/>7. Dating site that accept bitcoins.<br/><br/>8. Easy encryption and backup service.<br/><br/>Niche filled or being worked on:<br/><br/>1. Advertising clearing house like <a href=\"http://projectwonderful.com\">http://projectwonderful.com</a>. Suggested by mskwik.(I used projectwonderful to make tiny bit of money. I wonder if I can get more money from a bitcoin advertising clearing house) noagenda offered a large bounty on it and being worked on Biomike.<br/><br/><br/>2. Download site like rapidshare and other crappy host. Inconvenient captcha and required paypal. Bitcoin can possibly take both roles and streamline the whole process. Suggested by Kiba. Taken by Hippich. Eventually sprawned 3 competitors.<br/><br/>3. Freelancer site. Taken by whichspace.<br/><br/>4. Pizza order system. You can order on the web, from the commandline, from your smartphone, sms, etc. Taken by mizerydearia.</div>",

Download site like rapidshare and other crappy host. Inconvenient captcha and required paypal. Bitcoin can possibly take both roles and streamline the whole process. Suggested by Kiba.</div><br/>That could be an interesting project.\u00a0 I'd be willing to work on the technical side but not sure I really have time to do proper support/marketing.\u00a0 Anyone interested in partnering up?<br/></div>There will be nothing to market if there aren't anything to market. I suspect it required maybe only a week of development if you're competent. Other than that, it's about gaining critical mass of stuff to download before explosion, I suspect. Marketing can be something like gathering desirable and not illegal stuff to download, curating it, etc and than giving the link to people who want it. That can be done in your spare downtime until you find marketer worth his salt of set up an affiliate program that incentivized people to market for you.<br/><br/>Actually, I\u00a0 didn't suggested it originally, but somebody else did in the thread about p0rn.<br/></div><br/>( Those who are fans of IP enforcement should just skip this part. Just sayin'. )<br/><br/>That was me, and I was specifically talking about targeting the less than legal area of file sharing. <br/><br/>Put simply, you're just not going to find legal content that will be effective in that market. Anything like OSS is mirrored for free and people aren't going to pay to download. Content owners aren't game - it'd be just another CDN to them, why would they pay in bitcoin, and why would their users pay per download/MB/GB when they're already paying for the content? That niche is solely about pirated content - like it or not. <br/><br/>Marketing would take hardly any effort, as I'm sure (with a good enough user pay flow) we could offer higher conversion rates and payouts for affiliates than the other shady CC required websites. It would take time to work out a business plan, but the actual development would take no time at all. (I could do it in a couple of days with a full-time effort) The files themselves could be shoved onto S3 or something. Just have to have someone handy with numbers to make sure it's profitable - otherwise nobody's going to waste their time.<br/><br/>Something like x amount of BTC per GB or MB (instead of a monthly membership), with an affiliate system would take over that market. Lots of people are willing to pay for better access to niche pirated content, but are reluctant to offer up CC and personal info directly for obvious reasons. <br/><br/>I also don't see how bitcoin could be used as a captcha, those are used to make sure there's a human on the other end and not a spam bot...you could easily automate the payments. For this niche, it's paying for high bandwidth, concurrent downloads of pirated content; it just won't work otherwise IMO.<br/><br/>Agorist developers apply within.\u00a0 <img alt=\"Grin\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/grin.gif\"/><br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1268.msg14114#msg14114\">Quote from: kiba on September 26, 2010, 12:54:44 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\"><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1268.msg14112#msg14112\">Quote from: Anonymous on September 26, 2010, 12:05:29 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\"><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">2.

The payments would have to be higher than the potential profits of the spam and it would likely push it out of reach of the average consumer. I'm not going to pay $0.50 to post a blog comment, ever. A big spammer could do that a thousand times and still not cut into their bottom line. I think the fact that spammers use Mechanical Turk to break captchas already is the proof in the pudding.</div>",
