If there are several digital currencies in the future<br/>you will just sell your bitcoins and buy more secure (or more useful)\u00a0 digital coins instead.

And all the people who gave their address to that agency will get into trouble. <br/><br/>If there is a major flaw discovered in Bitcoin and there is no sufficient time to swap to a different system, I assume there is nothing you can do about a loss of your wealth. <br/><br/>Still, let's suppose YOU have discovered a way to produce an unlimited amount of coins. Your goal would be to profit from that secret AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. So even people that have the power to cheat wouldn't want a collapse of the digital fiat currency. And before the collapse of the old currency they would change their fake money for a better currency. But I am afraid that also goes for the so called \"real\" money. But.. somebody who has the brains to fool the algorithm of the digital currency at least gets a reward for his genius. In our paper fiat money system in the contrary, people who have access to the \"printing press\" of the government / central bank get rewarded for being just plain assholes. </div>",
