        "content": "<div class=\"post\">BitTorrent clients can do hundreds of connections easily - this is why they end up killing those little embedded routers.\u00a0 It should be no problem for a regular IP router but the little embedded things are doing NAT so they're tracking state on all those connections and run out of memory.. also they're very slow SoC style computers so everything going through them suffers.<br/><br/>Torrent clients generally have options for configuring a global maximum number of connections, maximum inbound and maximum outbound connections.<br/><br/>I think it would be good to allow configuration of unlimited inbound/outbound connections for those who have the capability to do it, and provide a conservative default for those who are using NAT, tor, proxies, etc.</div>",
