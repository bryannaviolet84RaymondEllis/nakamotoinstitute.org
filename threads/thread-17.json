        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Hello. My understanding of Bitcoin is not perfect, so I would like to ask questions about its operation. When Generating, the user will gain 50 coins after creating 120 blocks. Why does the program continue generating blocks after that point? And why does one not gain another 50 coins after generating 240 blocks?<br/><br/>Also, I sent a few coins to someone to test the transaction system. Even though it was just a few coins, that transaction's status currently reads \"166 blocks\". It seems that it will continue incrementing indefinitely. Why is this?<br/><br/>I thank responders for increasing my knowledge.</div>",

The number of blocks of a transaction means the number of new blocks in the whole block chain after the transaction. The whole block chain grows ad infinitum.</div>",
