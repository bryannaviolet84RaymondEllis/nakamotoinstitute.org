This can mean that a program can reach version 3 within a few months of development, before it is considered stable or reliable.<br/><br/>In contrast to this, the free-software community tends to use version 1.0 as a major milestone, indicating that the software is \"complete\", that it has all major features, and is considered reliable enough for general release.</div><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Version_1.0_as_a_milestone\">Quote Source</a><br/><br/>The above description is how I and most geeks view version 1.0 software.
