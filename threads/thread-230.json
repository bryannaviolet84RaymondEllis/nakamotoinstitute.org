Last I heard nanotube still had one that's unconfirmed, though.<br/><br/>Edit: Nanotube's transaction cleared recently. I don't know why it was delayed, since it wasn't relying on a sub-0.01 transaction.<br/></div><br/>just a clarification, the one that \"cleared recently\" didn't have anything to do with the problem microtransactions. the problem one, that was unconfirmed, is still unconfirmed, see info in my post above. </div>",
