The SSE version is a bit faster than the non-SSE version and both are inferior to the x64 builds, if you have a 64-bit OS, don't bother with these.<br/><br/><b>Beware however that the libeay32.dll that I included may have SSE and therefore, if you can't get either to run on your machine, replace that DLL with the one bundled with the stock Bitcoin</b><br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.4shared.com/file/kIewrXzp/Bitcoin_x86.html\">You can grab the builds here</a></div>",
