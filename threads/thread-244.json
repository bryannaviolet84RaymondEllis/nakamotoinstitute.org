        "content": "<div class=\"post\">This is based on a discussion on 11/14/2010 on the IRC channel.<br/><br/><b>BitDNS</b><br/><br/>Although there have been attempts to tackle DNS in a distributed way in the past, I don't think there have been solutions that have fully removed authority from the equation.<br/><br/>If there was such a solution, it probably would have been able to implement bitcoin directly on top of it, and we all know that didn't happen.<br/><br/>However, it seems possible to create a bitcoin clone (bitDNS) that provides a solution to distributed authority-free name allocation and transfer.<br/><br/>Basically, the system is a copy of bitcoin where miners generate 50 new name mappings of their choosing whenever they win a block.\u00a0 The name mappings change hands in a way similar to btc.<br/><br/>This system is separate from btc, and it is likely that escrow services will provide a name market in btc, since any such escrow can leverage the two block chains to verify transactions.\u00a0 Miners can pick names that are already being bid upon with funds in escrow to make sure they are able to sell generated names quickly.<br/><br/><b>Generalizing Bitcoin: BitX</b><br/><br/>This is all well and good, but now there are two block chains, and any given miner can only generate for one at a time.\u00a0 This will be really bad when even more clever applications are developed that require bitcoin-like properties but will be susceptible to attack in their early development.\u00a0 Enter BitX, designed to support any and every such application on a single block chain.<br/><br/>BitX has a block chain like bitcoin's.\u00a0 However, miners choose to distribute arbitrary application data in the following manner:<br/><br/>1) The payload in a block is a mapping from application names to hashes: [\"bitcoin\": &lt;hash&gt;, \"bitDNS\": &lt;hash&gt;, \"bitHaiku\": &lt;hash&gt;, ...]<br/><br/>2) Any given block is only allowed to create one new application that does not already appear somewhere in the block chain.\u00a0 This is to prevent spam.<br/><br/>3) Any given block may omit data for any application.\u00a0 Similarly to the current situation, miners have a choice as to what transactions to include, and this extends to the choice over which applications to choose to send data for.<br/><br/>4) Application data is transfered separately, so for instance a bitcoin client will never have to care about haikus or DNS names, as it can simply ask someone for the bitcoin payload and make sure it matches the hash in the appropriate block.<br/><br/>5) On the client side, blocks are only ever rejected for an error relating to the previous four points.\u00a0 In other words, blocks aren't rejected for carrying a faulty bitcoin payload, because this might result in rejecting valid DNS transfers.\u00a0 Instead, bitcoin clients accept the most recent block but ignore the invalid bitcoin transactions.<br/><br/>Miners will engage in activities they feel profitable.\u00a0 For example, miners may not see a profit motive in haikus, but will want to generate DNS names because they can be sold easily.\u00a0 I think this system could support a very wide range of useful applications while adding only a minimal overhead to the block chain itself.\u00a0 Application proliferation is kept in check by the interests of the miners themselves.<br/><br/>This also seems to make the block chain more modular, as it separates concerns; the block chain is strictly for creating a universal state of the system for everyone in the world, and application data travels out of band but is verified against the block chain.<br/><br/>One effect of the modularity is that applications can ignore illegal or undesirable application data and only download payloads for the applications they care about.<br/><br/>As a last thought: BitX poses a significant threat to bitcoin, because money may not be the \"killer app\" for the block chain.\u00a0 In other words, what happens when bitBeanieBabies becomes bigger than bitcoin?\u00a0 Suddenly the bitcoin system doesn't seem as secure.\u00a0 If both were running on top of BitX, they would enhance each other's security, and interfere with one another minimally.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading,<br/>Appamatto</div>",

Therefore all hashing clients need to have the logic to tell the good from the bad. Ths could be done by distributing the appropriate logic for each app as java bytecode or .NET stuff. All clients would therefore understand all apps.<br/><br/>There would have to be some incentive to support an app in this way. Some form of payment.... hmmm<br/><br/>ByteCoin<br/></div><br/>It is funny how people are thinking about the same issue at the same time.\u00a0 I have been trying to think of some way that another \"chain\" using Bitcoin principles of hashing might be able to use Bitcoins as a transaction fee:<br/><br/><a href=\"http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2028.0\">http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2028.0</a><br/><br/>The issue here is that you would need some way for those \"mining\" new blocks into this sort of DNS data block chain (or any other kind of similar data protected by a hash chain with miners) to receive some sort of transaction fee for processing that chain.\u00a0 In this case, the incentive for processing the DNS entries would be to receive these transactions fees.... which could be quite considerable depending on what people would be willing to pay for a domain name under this system.<br/><br/>I have considered perhaps an alternative, which would have the main Bitcoin miners of the main chain have as \"optional\" transactions to be processing in such a way that could let the miner itself keep these transaction fees.\u00a0 My main objection to doing that is that it puts far too much processing into miners and makes a bottleneck that I think we would all rather not have.\u00a0 Bitcoin miners ought to be for bitcoin transactions alone, but it is at least something to consider.<br/><br/>This thread I mention here goes into the technical details, but it is something that could help with this idea too.\u00a0 I haven't completely \"solved\" the problem, but I have at least identified what issues need to be solved.<br/><br/>Besides, it would be nice if there were other ways for those interested in using Bitcoins to be able to earn them since the main mining of coins is now being locked up with with stronger computers and GPU miners of various kind including server farms.<br/><br/>The one advantage here of using a fee is to avoid a tragedy of the commons, where those who want to register a domain or transfer \"ownership\" of that domain would have to put up real money to do so.\u00a0 The fees don't go to some central processing bureau or organization, but rather to those who are doing the real work, which is processing the actual domain registrations itself.</div>",

How is it done?<br/></div><br/>It depends on the domain registrar and a few other factors.\u00a0 Back when ICANN ran domain registrations directly, all you needed to do was to simply spoof the e-mail address of the person who made the registration and change the contact information... hoping that the reply from ICANN would get lost in the junk mail with spam and other garbage.\u00a0 Once you switched the contact information, switching almost everything else was incredibly trivial and a piece of cake.<br/><br/>It is a bit harder now and the domain registrars do require a bit more identifying information, but nothing that a good private investigator would be unable to provide.\u00a0 Really, the current domain registration is incredibly insecure and there are even \"legal\" means to \"steal domains\" that merely need a pretty competent attorney to cover your back if you want to do it through the judicial system.\u00a0 That is how nissan.com was taken from a small business in southern California in spite of the fact that the last name of the guy really was \"Nissan\" running a used car business with the name \"Nissan Motors\" and registered the domain well before the perhaps more famous automobile company got the domain changed.<br/><br/>On top of that, the DNS system itself is very much open to attack as long as you can somehow get trusted as a \"peer\" by one of the main root servers.\u00a0 There are various kinds of attacks upon DNS records themselves which can be done, some easier than others and some of them requiring better knowledge about computer networking than others, although there are some \"kiddie scripts\" and \"hackerwarez\" that you can get to do all of this is you really want to.\u00a0 I'd strongly suggest staying away from those program mainly because they are trojan and virus sources if you try to just Google for them.\u00a0 In other words a good way to get your system rooted and part of a bot net not under your control if that is your goal.\u00a0 If you want to go the hacker route, learning about the protocol itself and sticking to discussion groups is a much better route to go.<br/><br/>None of this is new to somebody who is familiar with the DNS system, and it really is just a house of cards much flimsier than what anybody can possibly believe if you aren't familiar with how it was all set up in the first place.<br/><br/>My point is that using a simple sort of cryptographic storage for the registration of the information is vastly more secure in terms of making sure the information doesn't get tampered with or manipulated that the current system.\u00a0 Even DNSSEC, the supposed \"savior\" of the DNS system to keep spoofing from happening (and largely unimplemented by most ISPs unfortunately even for that level of security) is only as good as the domain registrar's security.\u00a0 Social hacking can still happen.<br/><br/>It is for this reason that I think a bitcoin-related system would work much better and be insanely simple to operate.\u00a0 On top of that, there would be no gatekeeper in terms of who gets authority to decide if you get the registration.\u00a0 You simply apply, throw in the fees for processing the application, and the domain registration gets put into the system.<br/><br/>In terms of the \"leasing\" option, the only advantage of doing that which I can see is to make sure that the domain itself remains in the \"public domain\" at some point.\u00a0 Domain registration is a public service and unfortuantely there are people who have taken domain registrations as a sort of \"land grab\" where the earliest get the best stuff first.\u00a0 By putting a leasing ability into the standard (and the \"lease\" is from all of mankind, not any individual), it forces those who grabbed the domains early on to do some \"work\" or at least pay up to maintain those leases.\u00a0 Presumably if maintaining those domains is expensive, they'll simply let them expire rather than having to constantly renew the domains.\u00a0 It also provides a source of revenue for those who are mining blocks as well so it also maintains the integrity of the database... in other words the chain of blocks being used to keep track of all of this information.</div>",

Of course they have to be new names that were not in earlier blocks.<br/></div><br/>I hope we aren't at cross purposes here as there are multiple ideas. \u00a0My idea was more that you would throw in a \"transaction\" that would have a few bitcoins attached (as the transaction fee) so that any potential miner would be encouraged to put that particular \"registration\" into a block chain like the Bitcoin mining blocks. \u00a0The \"owner\" is merely the person who paid the fee and is identified by a private/public hash like the Bitcoin addresses are being used right now. \u00a0In fact, I would propose that the \"owner\" of a particular domain might as well be a Bitcoin address unless we can think of a more secure way of claiming such ownership.... which would be of value to the Bitcoin project if you can show it would be unsecure. \u00a0It is tying the domain ownership to your wallet.dat file making your wallet even more valuable if you got one of these domains. \u00a0The actual hash is irrelevant other than it should be defined in the protocol.<br/><br/>A block would have a limited number of \"transactions\" in it... perhaps just 1 but it could be 50 or slightly more. \u00a0I don't mind putting a limit at 50 per block in the sense that it might drive up the value of an individual domain and set up some interesting economic theories so far as supply and demand are concerned. \u00a0That is a network rule to define in this case. \u00a0Obviously a miner could create one of these \"domains records\" for \"free\", but then again they are contributing to defending the integrity of the database through CPU proof of work.<br/><br/>So really a domain entry would be:<br/><br/>\u00a0- the name itself (e.g. example.bitdns)<br/>\u00a0- a hash of the owning public key (e.g. djiusjfkrhffhdehyormavtrr...)<br/>\u00a0- an optional key which could identify a \"new\" owner in the case of somebody transferring control of the domain<br/>\u00a0- the IP address(es) of the authoritative DNS server for the name (e.g. 1.2.3.4)<br/>\u00a0- transaction fee paid in BTC<br/><br/>A block entry would also have a timestamp that could be rejected if it was for some time in the future<br/><br/>As a network rule any name collisions that can't be resolved as from the same person making a request for changes would be rejected. \u00a0The cost to run this network would be through the transaction fees, where a \"miner\" may be as inclusive or selective as they care based upon the transaction fees involved. \u00a0Miners might have a different fee schedule for \"new\" domains as opposed to existing domains and could discriminate on that basis... or simply only select to process one kind or another. \u00a0All of this would be essentially a marketplace where those trying to \"register\" domains are playing chicken with those making the blocks, presumably with the miners wanting higher fees and those registering domains wanting lower fees. \u00a0My bet is that domain registration fees would be considerably lower than what GoDaddy charges or for that matter any other domain registrar other than those who simply do it for free. \u00a0Maintaining the DNS records does have a cost, which is the purpose of the transaction fee as well.<br/><br/>The only glitch here that I can see is trying to get those transaction fees to the miner. \u00a0The miner needs to be able to demonstrate proof of work before they get paid, and presumably that the proof involved has generally been accepted into the network before they get paid as well. \u00a0Otherwise, all I can see is that people are being altruistic and simply mining as a free public good.... which has problems related to a tragedy of the commons as well. \u00a0I personally think that you should \"pay your own freight\" for things like this. \u00a0Besides, it provides another way for people to earn bitcoins simply by leaving their computer running if you can get the transaction fees for running such a DNS mining application processing these records.<br/><br/>BTW, I created a stub of a document on the wiki for this concept if anybody is interested in filling out some more details of this idea in terms of a formal spec:<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=bitdns_draft_0_1\">http://www.bitcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=bitdns_draft_0_1</a><br/><br/>I'll see what I can contribute to filling this out, and I'm thinking of bumping this idea up on my own priority schedule for perhaps writing an application to do this. \u00a0It sounds like something to really get my teeth into even though I got a couple of other good ideas I'd like to try. \u00a0Besides, it sounds like there is some real interest to get this going sooner rather than later among many in the Bitcoins community.</div>",

I have an idea about the transaction fee. What if this were integrated with Bitcoin itself? This would be a different kind of transaction that would be mixed with regular Bitcoin transactions and included in regular Bitcoin blocks. Then the block creator would automatically receive the transaction fee just like all the other tx fees in the block.<br/><br/>If that sounds good, I see a way this could be implemented into the current Bitcoin system compatibly with current clients. We could use the mysterious and extravagant \"scripting\" system to add additional data to regular Bitcoin transactions. These would look like NOPs to current clients and be ignored, but BitDNS aware clients would look inside this NOP block and see the extra DNS data, and interpret it as BitDNS transfers.<br/><br/>Specifically i could imagine using OP_NOP1 to mean BitDNS, then OP_PUSHDATA to push the DNS info, then OP_DROP to drop it from the stack, followed by the regular tx opcodes. This will have no effect on regular clients and look like a regular transaction (can be a dummy tx, 0.01 to yourself) but BitDNS aware code sees a BitDNS transaction. This is actually a powerful general technique for adding overlay protocols to Bitcoin.<br/><br/></div>",

&lt;dot&gt; &lt;domain&gt; &lt;dot&gt; &lt;top level domain&gt;<br/><br/>There was an historical reason for the original divisions for .com, .mil, and .edu.\u00a0 They represented three distinct and separate networks originally called \"COM-NET\", \"MIL-NET\", and \"EDU-NET\".\u00a0 It is sort of like how telephone systems used to be completely separated between business exchanges and residential exchanges.\u00a0 When the three networks were finally linked, they had to use some way to identify how to access computers on one network to another, so the \"TLD\" system was originally set up and some other side \"TLDs\" were made for \"miscellaneous organizations\" (.org), \"international organizations\" (.int), and generic \"network resources\" (.net).\u00a0 When people outside of America were participating in adding their networks to the internet, they were identified by their country code , now the various \"country code top level domains\".<br/><br/>Mind you, when the codes were handed out, there was the .us domain which seemed redundant (it was) but those already having .com didn't want to go to a longer .com.us.<br/><br/>Anyway, I contend that the whole notion here of a top level domain is something that completely unnecessary, and that viewpoint has been long advocated by <a href=\"http://www.cavebear.com/\">Karl Auerbach</a>.\u00a0 If you've never heard of this guy, it should be important that he was the one and unfortunately only official <b>elected representative</b> of North America to ICANN, and sort of a major rebel.\u00a0 He was one of the \"at-large\" directors that had to get a California court to force ICANN to actually show him their books (he was one of the members of their board of directors and supposedly recognized as such by the organization) and because of his efforts his position was dissolved by the appointed board members made up of people hand-picked by major corporations.\u00a0 The whole experiment of democratically elected representatives to ICANN was killed by the U.S. Department of Commerce... isn't that something?<br/><br/>Anyway, if anybody knows DNS backward and forward, it is Karl Auerbach, and one of his positions when he was on the ICANN board was that there was no need to even have a top-level domain system at all, and certainly the number of top level domains could certainly number in the millions or more.\u00a0 It is simply a directory.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.cavebear.com/archive/nsf-dns/\">This history paper</a> about DNS goes into the gritty details of how it finally got started.\u00a0 This really is a seminal paper on the history of DNS in terms of how we got to where we are today.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.cavebear.com/archive/nsf-dns/ntia-comments.html\">Another paper by Karl Auerbach</a> is certainly worth reading so far as to see what a very well thought out objection to the current DNS system as implemented by ICANN was and how when the whole system was created had people proposing some significant alternatives.\u00a0 Since supposedly we are talking about alternatives to the centralized DNS, I think this ought to be at least one of the key papers worth reading.\u00a0 It shouldn't be surprising that the problems he identified over twenty years ago are still present in the current system, and it is important to note that there was opposition back then even to the current system.\u00a0 If you read between the lines, he was even upset over how IP addresses were allocated... which is a completely different beast altogether.<br/><br/>I don't think that those working with this new \"dot P2P\" effort are really reading stuff of this nature.\u00a0 I find it too bad as well, as it shows the immoral and arguably illegal actions taken by those who set up the current system almost as if it was a sort of Jekyll Island episode of the Internet.\u00a0 There are a whole bunch of common parallel themes between the formation of ICANN and the Federal Reserve.\u00a0 In this sense, perhaps Bitcoin really is a good fit as it sort of is a merger of the two systems that have been corrupted by aristocrats in a supposedly egalitarian and \"officially\" classless society.<br/><br/>In short, I think that the \"dot P2P\" effort is doomed to failure if the continue down the path they are going and not addressing the real problems facing the current system.\u00a0 Many of those problems are being addressed by BitDNS, even if it is a bit marginalized at the moment.\u00a0 And I also think that the argument about lost keys is not something nearly as significant either compared to the major issues about what is wrong with the current DNS system.</div>",

So you have plenty of time to choose a new domain name, set it up, and install redirects from your existing site.<br/><br/>You can protect against this by leaving a copy of your keys with a couple of trusted people. That's a much better solution than leaving your domain name hostage to an untrusted registrar.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, Turkmenistan was selling .tm domain names and I registered one. After a couple of years, the Turkmenistan government decided there were .tm websites they didn't like and they removed access to the domain name. But there was plenty of time to get a new domain and install redirects. It worked just fine.<br/><br/>Ultimately, a name is just a name and it's not the end of the world if one is lost. Even cocacola.com could switch to cocacola2.com and it wouldn't be the end of the world.<br/><br/></div>",

With people able to pay for domains from those who've managed to generate them using whatever payment method they want to agree on.<br/><br/>Do we have a wiki yet?<br/></div><br/>Well, I've proposed that Bitcoins be used as an incentive for mining the chains, which I suppose is a way to promote the use of Bitcoins as well. \u00a0If you are talking about the \"miners\" simply creating their own floating currency that could then in turn be put into one of the exchanges.... that may solve the problem of getting miners paid (hmmm.... I've got to think about that one for a little bit) but it does create the problem of what anybody is going to do with that \"floating currency\"?<br/><br/>Just thinking aloud here... if we used a \"floating currency\" in this system instead that was a \"DomainChain coin\" similar to Bitcions but not pegged to Bitcions as all, could that work here? \u00a0I'm sure Mt. Gox would certainly be interested in exchanging these coins if they had some value, and the point here is mainly to come up with the formula for creating these coins. \u00a0The only real use of these coins would be to pay registration fees for domain names, so I think the drop-off could happen a lot faster than is the case with Bitcoins. \u00a0<br/><br/>In theory we could even set up some sort of link to Mt. Gox or some other trader so that in the interface you could do a \"quick buy\" of these \"DomainChain coins\" in such a way that for an end-user they would be buying them with BTC and then putting those recently purchased coins right into the transaction as a fee for the miner to claim when it gets put into the chain. \u00a0If the transaction block is rejected, that miner loses the claim to those coins and they become unconfirmed.... where it is the responsibility for the exchange to worry about the validity of a particular set of \"DomainChain coins\". \u00a0A similar kind of \"quick exchange\" could even happen with LR Dollars or any other currency that may be tied to some exchange system, or they could simply get the \"coins\" on a \"manual\" basis from the exchange if they wanted to get a better exchange rate or have somebody \"send\" them some of these \"DomainChain coins\" with a direct hand-over of cash.<br/><br/>I like this a whole lot. \u00a0It may \"solve\" this problem I've been thinking of in terms of getting miners paid. \u00a0Are there any other hiccups anybody sees with this situation? \u00a0The exchange itself isn't even fixed.<br/><br/>The only real problem I see is that it sets up a situation where this kind of currency could supplant the main Bitcoin for intrinsic value. \u00a0Not overnight, but gradually. \u00a0We need somebody with a whole lot more economic theory behind them to figure this one out, because I would vote for a \"weaker\" currency than Bitcions be set up in this situation, however we want to define that. \u00a0How would you set up the parameters for a relatively strong currency that the desire would be to trade it in for Bitcions instead when possible? \u00a0Would the fact that Bitcions has an absolute limit but these kind of \"DomainChain coins\" would continue to inflate (aka the 50 DCC produced per block would continue to be produced indefinitely creating a mild sort of inflation over time) be sufficient to make Bitcoins stronger?<br/><br/>I need to think overnight on this particular subject as it is starting to make my head ache thinking about it, but it sounds like an interesting idea to seriously consider.</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I also had an idea last night of how/where to tie this into the existing DNS.<br/><br/>When you lookup foo.com, software on your computer called a resolver is responsible. It has some caching and local data, but mostly it just asks a DNS server for the answer. You have one or more DNS servers configured as part of your network setup, and these servers respond to domain name lookup queries either directly, or by initiating their own search of the domain name system.<br/><br/>Obviously we want existing name lookups still to work. Broadly speaking, then, we would change the software to first check if a name is registered in the BitDNS system, and if not, to fall back to the regular handling.<br/><br/>My idea is that the best place to add the BitDNS lookup code is in a DNS server rather than in the resolver. Resolvers are different for every OS, so there's more work. I don't even know if the resolver logic can be changed on Windows. Plus this code is going to need to be tracking the BitDNS block chain, and not every end user should have to do this.<br/><br/>Other 'alternative' DNS systems do it like this, with one or more special DNS servers that know about their extra domains.<br/><br/>We would choose some open source DNS server as a base, fork it and add the code to lookup BitDNS names. Whether these names all have a distinguishing TLD \".bit\" or whether we are more aggressive and take over more namespace, either way it could be done.<br/><br/>As I understand it, when a DNS server looks up foo.com, it finds the (or a) name server authoritative for .com, and asks it for what is called a SOA record for foo.com. This tells what name servers are authoritative for foo.com, and the DNS server then tries them to get details on foo.com.<br/><br/>We would intercept this first step, and use the BitDNS code to find the authoritative name servers. Maybe we could create a dummy SOA record to hold the data, to simplify falling back into the regular DNS code.<br/><br/>People who want to use BitDNS would just have to select one of the BitDNS aware DNS servers.

So it seems necessary to make names faster.<br/></div><br/>The question as to how many domains to include in a block ought to be something dependent upon the miner alone. \u00a0This certainly is a useful point to bring up and likely an early \"reference implementation\" limit will be 50 domains per block merely to increase scarcity. \u00a0Still, that up to 300k changes might happen eventually with this system, perhaps more considering that the cost is likely going to be considerably less than the current domain registration system.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I have a few other thoughts about this now that we are getting to something a little more concrete in terms of the software architecture. \u00a0Would it be reasonable to expect the cost of a domain registration to be 1 DCC (Domain Coin Currency)... at least as the \"default\" cost expected by the miner to \"register\" a domain? \u00a0I think that would establish at least an initial value to the currency and help to self-regulate those who want to jump in early and grab up a whole bunch of domains early on. \u00a0I might even go so far as to say 2 DCC for registration and 1 DCC for information changes. \u00a0If you run your own miner, you can \"tweak\" this if you want to be more competitive, but this is the way that you can spend the currency and what it is based upon and a fair benchmark.<br/><br/>In terms of a social effect that may be negative (depending on your viewpoint) some of the country code TLDs represent a substantial source of income for some of countries involved. \u00a0One in particular, the country of Tuvalu, has only a little over 12,000 citizens and is the smallest member-nation of the United Nations in terms of population and pretty close to that in terms of land area. \u00a0Only the Vatican has a smaller population in terms of a sovereign state. \u00a0Its current TLD (*.tv) is currently run by a company in California but a significant portion of the revenue from that domain goes to the country's government under contract.<br/><br/>On the topic of small countries and their \"country codes\", it seems like if we could get this software rather stable, we might even want to offer this \"service\" to some of these smaller countries for their domain registrations, where I'm pretty sure that this would be cheaper than whatever contract they currently have with their current service provider. \u00a0That goes under \"marketing\", but something else to think about. \u00a0I certainly think that it would be awesome if we could get a whole country like Tonga to switch to Bitcoins as their national currency, and is much more likely to happen than the major western countries like America or the EU. \u00a0Just dreaming there.</div>",

Gox could use the same JSON API system for Bitcoin on this system as well, particularly as the exchanges wouldn't have to play with the domain information but rather just the coin trading mechanisms. \u00a0Exchanges would want to get into the act as there certainly are arbitrage opportunities between the DCC and BTC currencies.<br/><br/>Our hard part is to define the \"rules\" of what domain information needs to be present, and when a block can be rejected because of mal-formed domain data. \u00a0That is where I think it would be wrong to put this more directly into the Bitcoin block chain, as rejecting Bitcoin blocks because of a malformed domain record seems to be harmful to Bitcoins.</div>",

It is true, the first domain name is likely much more valuable than the millionth.

That means transaction fees might have to rise substantially over time.<br/><br/>Is it worth considering to increase the block creation rate above 6 per hour?

No reduction in names/block I assume? Won't this make the first blocks incredible valuable and later blocks less valuable as the goodness of remaining names declines? Maybe it should start really low (1?) and move up gradually to a stable amount (100?)?<br/></div><br/>This was on another thread but is relevant here. It is true, the first domain name is likely much more valuable than the millionth. So even if we don't reduce the number of DCC per block, the value will decrease much like Bitcoin does by halving the block reward every two years. That means transaction fees might have to rise substantially over time.<br/><br/>Is it worth considering to increase the block creation rate above 6 per hour? If we generate blocks every 5 minutes or even every 2-3 minutes instead of every 10, that would be another way to speed up domain name availability.<br/></div><br/>One of the reasons to maintain the 10 minute interval between blocks is because of network latency from distant node in terms of \"hops\" between nodes. \u00a0If you shorten the interval you risk more \"collisions\" between nodes that may have simultaneously created a \"successful block\". \u00a0In turn that also can make even longer \"chains\" start to compete against each other.<br/><br/>In other words keeping the 10 minute interval may be a very good idea or even increasing the interval could have benefits. \u00a0I know of at least some blocks even with this average that have time stamps which even go \"negative\" where the successive block is timestamped a few seconds <i>before</i> the previous block. \u00a0More likely it was created at almost the same time but the other block literally was created a matter of a few seconds earlier.<br/><br/>I would like to put in perhaps a more continuous or shorter interval between difficulty adjustments, but then again there are some network attacks which are thwarted by the two-week readjustment system.<div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg27645#msg27645\">Quote from: em3rgentOrdr on December 07, 2010, 04:56:51 AM</a></div><div class=\"quote\"><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg27629#msg27629\">Quote from: kiba on December 07, 2010, 04:30:24 AM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">At any rate, do we have enough information that's agreed so that the core hackers can develop right now?<br/></div><br/>Well before starting coding, let's make sure we have the protocol clearly written out. \u00a0For instance, are we going to take my suggestion of using unitary, non-fractional, bitdnscoins where 1 block == 1 bitdnscoin, instead of having the number of bitdnscoins per block start at 50 and half every few years? \u00a0Also, there is no need for fractional bitdnscoins since it doesn't make too much sense to own one-tenth of a domain name. \u00a0Keep in mind that people can use fiat money or even bitcoins when trading unitary bitdnscoins, incase they need to make a trade of two domain names with unequal subjective valuations.<br/><br/></div><br/>The exchanges might really appreciate at least some fractional quantities to play with, although that could also be internal to the exchange itself. \u00a0The real advantage is for some granularity in terms of competing miners which might want to snag a few additional registrations. \u00a0It would also help in terms of setting up a per-kilobyte charge for people throwing stuff into the coin transactions too. \u00a0Attacks on the network can also happen through filling up coin transaction information with useless junk, and charging a fee for that can help stop or at least slow down such a flood attack and at least put cost to such an attack that must be borne by the person making the transaction.\u00a0 Such a charge may require at least some fractional coins, even if it isn't nanocoins necessarily.</div>",

chain purposes.\u00a0 <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/><br/></div><br/>An interesting thread related to this can be found here: <a href=\"http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2124.0\">http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2124.0</a><br/><br/>Theymos has been discussing how to put miscellaneous data into the transaction blocks themselves, but there are dangers to doing that.\u00a0 It also shows some incredibly strong resistance to \"tweaking\" Bitcion itself as a software package to permitting this kind of activity, which seems to me as coming from at least a source that would end up killing any attempt to put a patch into Bitcoin to permit data inclusion for something other than the \"stealth\" method with transactions.<br/><br/>While the suggestion that Git itself ought to be sufficient for cryptographic timestamping and cryptographic data storage (that is interesting by itself... something I haven't thought about), I don't know enough about Git to say much about it at all in terms of its distributed nature.<br/><br/>I firmly believe you should \"pay your own freight\" so far as anything which costs others to do, which is why I think this proposal is incredibly useful.\u00a0 There are costs associated with domain name registration and data storage, and they aren't trivial expenses either.\u00a0 The concept of Bitcions enables those costs to be borne by those who use the service.\u00a0 I tried to explore this idea further on this thread:\u00a0 <a href=\"http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1764.0\">http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1764.0</a><br/><br/>This is indeed a political idea here too, which is where perhaps it is getting some resistance as well.\u00a0 The idea could be summed up with the concept that \"you get what you pay for\".\u00a0 Places like Source Forge offer their \"services\" for free, but there are hidden costs including being tied to other outside interests.... mainly the advertisers and those who are paying for the \"service\".\u00a0 With what we are proposing for BitDNS/Domain Chain is that the service is going to be focused upon those who are paying for the service.... which is those who are making the registrations.\u00a0 They have the most to lose if this project falls apart.\u00a0 If the registrants aren't happy with the service, fees are going to go down and the DCC is going to collapse as a currency.\u00a0 That in turn is going to cause developers to be very strongly focused upon meeting the needs of that community.<br/><br/>The other aspect which is really interesting here is that the process of becoming a \"registrar\" has a very low barrier to entry.\u00a0 I'm sure many people would love to have had the chance to do something like being BigDaddy or Verisign in terms of processing domain registrations and receiving the fees for doing that.\u00a0 Now the chance to perform that sort of \"business\" at least on a part time basis is at least possible.\u00a0 No single person or even central organization is going to be receiving the fees but rather a \"community\" that is open to newcomers and even people with modest technical skills.<br/><br/>I've also seen complaints that \"open source software\" doesn't pay.\u00a0 Bitcoin can change that model, including doing things like we are talking about here with the DomainCoin system.\u00a0 Not only can a bounty system be set up for integrating a specific feature into the system, but the developer can also have a continuing source of income afterward.\u00a0 BTW, in deference to Kiba, the license itself is immaterial here too and can simply be thrown into the public domain, even though I think that copyleft licenses tend to offer much stronger protections against idiots who would attempt to mess with you in the legal system.\u00a0 You may want to avoid the judicial system, but sometimes it comes and bites you hard even if you are active in trying to stay out of its reach.\u00a0 Time is really the one resource that anybody has to sell when you finally get down to the gritty details of economics, and it takes time to be a developer to create projects like this.\u00a0 Also, even simply maintaining the software afterward takes time and effort, fixing bugs that show up and perhaps putting in tweaks.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough of the issue with the overhead costs.\u00a0 I am afraid that this is going to effectively split or fork the Bitcoin network, and that isn't a good thing either.\u00a0 I want to work with the Bitcoin community, but if they won't have us, we may have to move on.\u00a0 Threats to Bitcoin will still be relevant and I'm not going to leave completely in a huff, but as a separate application it will be essentially a fork of Bitcoin if we proceed with the path I've suggested in terms of a completely separate coin chain and currency.\u00a0 It might be interesting so far as a social experiment is concerned to see which way is better and which \"coin\" is going to be more accepted in the long run.\u00a0 I am challenging some of Satoshi's assumptions here too, but not overly so.\u00a0 Two very similar project with slightly different goals but which also support each other might be beneficial to each other as well, especially as there is going to be a huge amount of common ground to work with.</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">OK, here goes. My design for DomainChain builds on many of the ideas expressed here already. My main contribution is to remove \"generation\" from the design. It turns out that relying only on transaction fees makes everything very much simpler, and makes it easy to piggyback DomainChain onto Bitcoin.<br/><br/>Here's a quick summary:<br/><br/><ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><li>Bitcoin already allows for a text \"payload\" to be included with a transaction. Any bitcoin transaction that is sent with the right payload becomes a domain name registration.</li><li>To register a domain name, just send any amount of bitcoin to yourself, with a special payload. This payload identifies itself as a DomainChain payload, and contains the desired domain name plus the IP address of the authoritative name server(s). If no-one else already has that name registered, it's yours.</li><li>To transfer a domain name to someone else, just send them the associated bitcoin (actually any part of the associated transaction will do). The GUI will let you do this in terms of \"domain names\" rather than in terms of \"coins\".</li><li>To change the authoritative name server(s), just send the associated bitcoin to yourself with a payload that identifies the new authoritative name server(s)</li><li>Registrations last forever unless you terminate them by sending that bitcoin to yourself with a payload that is a DomainChain \"cancel\" message</li><li>You can register a domain name with the smallest convenient amount of bitcoins (currently 0.01 BTC), so the system imposes no scarcity of domain names. However, miners will impose transaction fees which increase as the block size increases. This provides a disincentive to registration spammers</li><li>To resolve (lookup) a domain name, the block chain is scanned for the most recent valid transaction for that domain name. In principle, anyone can run a DomainChain resolver, but in practice most users will use a DNS service that is DomainChain-aware</li></ul><br/>Advantages:<br/><br/><ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><li>Provides domain name registration with the same level of pseudonymity as Bitcoin</li><li>Holds registration data in a tamper-resistant distributed manner</li><li>Strengthens Bitcoin by providing additional economic incentive for generators (because they will be able to charge transaction fees for domain name transactions)</li><li>Can be implemented much more quickly than any other scheme that has been proposed so far</li><li>Existing bitcoin clients <del>are unaffected. If they receive coins that are associated with a domain name registration they will see them as coins.</del> do not display domain name registration transactions. No modification is needed.</li></ul><br/>Disadvantages:<br/><br/>(I'm sure you'll let me know of the disadvantages.)<br/><br/>Implementation:<br/><br/>1. Patch the standard bitcoin client. Run it on the bitcoin test network. The patched client will have a separate panel for domain names that are associated with bitcoins. These bitcoins will not show on the standard panel, nor will they be included in the total balance available to spend. On the DomainChain panel, instead of a \"send coin\" button there will be buttons for \"register a new name\", \"change nameservers\", \"transfer a name\" and \"abandon a name\". There will also be a scrolling list of domain names together with their nameservers.<br/><br/>2. Write a program that scans the block chain to determine the authoritative domain name servers for a given domain name. Patch a standard open source domain name server to consult the output of this program as part of its name resolution.<br/><br/>3. If it works well, persuade Satoshi to allow these transactions in the main network.

The block chain only has value because a majority of users are prepared to interpret it in a certain way, according to certain rules.

Other proposals envisioned a single new TLD like .bitdns.<br/><br/>Names can be changed when registered, but only from one TLD to another. You could change pics.sex to pics.p2p. I don't understand the motivation for this. It seems like something that would seldom be useful.<br/><br/>I'm still confused about fees. I was assuming that fees would be paid to the DNS servers, for the service of acting as a gateway from the Bitcoin block chain to the DNS system. I now see another interpretation, where DNS servers don't receive the fees, but they nevertheless demand that transaction fees of a certain minimum level be paid to miners. As long as they see that the domain name was registered with a large enough transaction fee to the miner, they will pass it through to the DNS. Is it possible that this is what was intended?<br/><br/>The proposal seems to envision a relatively small set of DNS servers that would be authorities for these new domain names and be the ones who bring the names from the block chain into DNS. These would be somewhat analogous to registrars today. (I may be misunderstanding this!) Each of these DNS servers publishes a schedule of fees for performing this service. To register a new name... hmm, I am guessing now. Would you contract with one particular DNS server to do something else than host your regular DNS records?<br/><br/>I had thought it would be ok to expect DNS servers to follow the block chain and honor valid domain name transactions without requiring certain minimum fees. Domain names are so valuable (at least at first) that miners already have ample motivation to demand substantial (like $100 = 500 Bitcoins per transaction) fees. Eventually, if the system is successful, virtually all DNS servers would read the block chain.</div>",

To get in one of these, you'll have to pay them directly in addition to the fees that go to whoever generates the block. This can be done with additional outputs, or you can pay on their site in the traditional Bitcoin way. This is where a registrar is especially useful, since they will know all of the current fee requirements of the various servers, and they can pay them all at once automatically.<br/></div><br/>In other words, this isn't really a distributed or P2P DNS system, or perhaps I'm missing something else here too.\u00a0 Each \"TLD\" would have its own central server where you would have to \"pay\" to get onto that server?<br/><br/>What I don't see is the mechanism for how or even why a particular DNS server ought to even receive these fees as opposed to somebody else creating a \"registrar server\" and following this same protocol to put that data into Bitcions for considerably less or even \"free\".\u00a0 This issue of where the money goes has been to me the issue all along, and the only place that could be identified easily as having done some sort of \"proof of work\" in terms of organizing the data is the block miner itself.... that is the Bitcoin block miner and not the DNS block miner as there is no sort of DNS block here at all.<br/><br/>I don't see any rationale for using a particular registrar other than merely because of sheer convenience and the hassle of setting up the software on your computer.<br/><br/>If there is some way that you might show some cryptographic \"proof of work\" in processing domain records, I might agree that a particular \"registrar\" deserves some separate fees in addition to the Bitcoin miner, but then the problem is how do you get those fees to that particular \"DNS Block miner\"?\u00a0 Otherwise there isn't any sort of effort being put forth by the registrar at all where literally anybody could create some software to put these records into the system.<br/><br/>I could imagine a system where a sort of auction system on a particular domain happens where the person throwing the most number of bitcions in for a registration record \"wins\" the domain, but something seems a little off on that as well.\u00a0 It also implies that anybody can \"steal\" your domain simply by throwing more coins at it than you have.\u00a0 It is a great idea for miners, but lousy for those trying to register domains.<br/><br/>This is all about the money from my perspective, and this part has not been cleaned up for me upon reading the documentation.\u00a0 The actual storage of the registration data itself has always been to me a trivial piece of the puzzle.\u00a0 Throwing those records into Bitcoin transactions are useful as they do provide the time stamping and hashing ability of Bitcoin software, but any fees beyond Bitcoin transaction fees seem to be a pointless exercise without any sort of further proof-of-work.\u00a0 Any additional fees being thrown with the \"registration\" is not going to anybody actually putting effort in terms of running the domain server or doing registrations.\u00a0 I could imagine some \"greedy\" DNS servers that might expect to be paid for bandwidth and being paid in Bitcoins or some other currency, or perhaps a very small fee for actually putting the transaction into the Bitcoin blocks for those who only have a \"thin client\" for Bitcoins, but those fees would be subject to a huge and highly competitive market where for most people it would be \"free\" anyway.<br/><br/>This is why I was trying to put together some sort of proof of work chain for data of this nature too, in part to put some scarcity into creating domain records.</div>",

In particular, if someone registers a top-level domain such as \"theymos.\", most servers will probably map it to \"theymos.btc\" or something.<br/></div><br/>I really don't get this. What's the point of having a \"right-hand-side\" if it is advisory? The user doesn't want to have to type <i>theymos.bc</i> into their browser when they're at an internet cafe that uses one DNS, but have to type <i>theymos.btcdns</i> into their browser at home if their ISP uses a different DNS. And if they just type \"<i>theymos</i>\", what if they are on a LAN that has a node called theymos?<br/><br/>Any default right-hand-side should be explicit in the spec. Also, I don't think something hard-to-pronounce like \".btcdns\" is going to work with the public.

The next week, names of nine characters or longer would be accepted. And so on, until by week ten any length will be accepted.<br/><br/>A more sophisticated phasing would hash the domain name to a number from 1 to 1000. On each of the first thousand days, names that hash to that day's number are added to those that can be registered. So, by day 42 it would be possible to register any domain name that hashed to a number in the range 1 to 42. After day 1000, any name could be registered.<br/><br/>A third possibility is simply to limit the number of registrations. Suppose each block limited the maximum number of domain name registrations to the current generation difficulty divided by 1024. For now, that would mean 8 domain name registrations per block, but the limit would rise over time (quite quickly, I think).<br/><br/>I'm not convinced that a registration rush needs to avoided, but technical measures can be used to avoid a rush if it is desired to do so.</div>",

They could, however, register <i>google.domain</i> but they would probably have to fight with Google in court under trademark law.<br/><br/>We really don't want the DomainChain system saying that it will \"protect\" 1000 names but \"refuse to protect\" all the rest.<br/></div><br/>Agreed. \u00a0I suggested in my previous domain allocation system that the standard ICANN/InterNIC domains and perhaps to be fair some of the domains currently being done with other networks like OpenNIC and the .onion \"domain\" of the Bittorrent network ought to be held in \"reserve\" as a part of the internal protocol we are setting up here. \u00a0My suggested domain allocation system would have that as an organic part of the system although it would be useful to hold these TLD in escrow for whenever or if ICANN wants to have control of them.<br/><br/>Since to use one of the TLDs with a server you would need to have it assigned to an IP address of some sort, somebody like Google could go aver \"google.btc\" as a trademark violation by searching for the network which assigned the IP address of the server using that name. \u00a0If the domain record points to 127.0.0.1, it really isn't a threat to Google until that address changes anyway. \u00a0I agree that this is beyond the scope of this protocol to take care of the Alexa top 1000 names and the only real issue is spoofing existing domain names being used by other DNS registries.<br/><br/>As a side note, during the actual reference implementation of one of these servers it would be nice to throw a bone to OpenNIC and the \"dot P2P\" guys (presuming they set up their own system) to forward DNS requests that might fall under those respective domain registries. \u00a0This is sort of a tip of the hat to say thanks for making sure ICANN doesn't have 100% exclusive control over domain registrations and to support what I think are good projects in their own right even if they aren't a P2P distributed naming system. \u00a0That might even get a reciprocal agreement with those alternate domain registries to spread these registrations with the DomainChain registries much further at least initially.</div>",

There's talk of the renewals being required perhaps as frequently as every 2000 blocks, and certainly no more than every 52000 blocks.<br/><br/>Over 10 years, the theymos/nanotube design might store anywhere between 600 bytes and 120,000 bytes per domain name.<br/><br/>I'm starting to think that an everlasting registration really is the way to go. In the DomainChain design, the registration would not be affected by block chain compaction, since compaction only affects spent transactions. If you transfer a DomainChain registration, or modify its name servers, all of the necessary information is contained in the latest transaction, which will remain unspent until the registration is deliberately modified. However, the theymos/nanotube design requires a sequence of transactions (registration, extra fee, DNS record, ...) where only the last transaction in the sequence remains unspent.<br/><br/>I think users will be uneasy about having to renew every 2000 or even 52000 blocks. Having to remember to renew, in order to avoid losing your registration, is bad enough. But block generation rates are variable, so that you won't even know for sure when your renewal falls due. Unpredictable renewals are not something that would make me feel good about using such a system for my domain name registrations. I can see many accidental domain name losses occurring under this system.<br/><br/>Obviously there needs to be a business case made that non-expiring domain names will work.

To get in one of these, you'll have to pay them directly in addition to the fees that go to whoever generates the block. This can be done with additional outputs, or you can pay on their site in the traditional Bitcoin way. This is where a registrar is especially useful, since they will know all of the current fee requirements of the various servers, and they can pay them all at once automatically.<br/><br/>People who run their own servers will not get a fee like this, but will rely only on the block fee. Configure your server to require the fee that you think is best, and you will see only those domains that have paid that fee or above.<br/></div><br/>Re-reading this, I think I \"get\" how this is going to work for registrars, at least how Theymos is proposing here.<br/><br/>Each \"Domain server\" would separately and independently charge a fee for \"registering\" the domain on that particular server, where essentially everybody would be paid simultaneously when a new domain would be registered.<br/><br/>Something here just doesn't sound right, which is why I keep bringing this up.\u00a0 I don't see the mechanism for recognizing new domain servers or what criteria ought to be used so far as to whom these fees are going to be allocated.\u00a0 A domain server which is regularly being used by just a couple computers in a small office would in this case be a \"peer\" to a domain server at a major university servicing perhaps thousands of computers for domains.\u00a0 Yet in this case both would be receiving registration fees and from a network perspective would be indistinguishable.\u00a0 However getting \"your domain\" recognized by that major university server would be much more \"valuable\" than the server in a small office.\u00a0 Any attempt to report usage could easily be manipulated in a number of ways making it to me impossible to realistically distinguish between the two servers, at least algorithmically.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm missing something fundamental here.\u00a0 I sure hope so.\u00a0 It seems sort of silly for somebody to set up a \"domain name server\" on their home computer and essentially sit back and earn bitcoins simply by being connected to the internet alone (no proof of work), receiving payments for domain registrations that are never used.\u00a0 That sounds like a neat gig to get into, but I don't understand what \"service\" they are providing to the community for doing that or why the fees ought to be paid yet other domain servers who are clearly being used by thousands of computers are going to be considered \"equal\" and receive roughly the same amount of money?</div>",

We should also dispense with the concept of paying more if we want better visibility for our domain names.<br/><br/>No-one wants a system where some people can reach <i>some.domain</i> and some people can't, depending on which servers are getting their share of the payment. Or a system where a new server can come to prominence and put pressure on people to pay again for the domains they already paid for.<br/><br/>Let's cut it down to the <b>simplest business model that can work</b>.<br/><br/>Suppose there are some generators who will include domain name registrations into blocks that they generate, because they want to earn the transaction fees. Those generators will operate public-facing domain name servers.<br/><br/>Why? They need to do this, to make the domain name service credible so that people will use DomainChain for their domain registrations. For the generators, it's an overhead, but a necessary one. Kind of like how most restaurants provide toilets without charging separately for them.<br/><br/>You could argue that there will also be some operators who would generate, and who would collect the transaction fees for domain name registrations, but who would not operate a server. After all, why incur the overhead if the other generators will operate the servers?<br/><br/>But the market will take care of this. The generators who do operate servers are not going to accept the blocks generated by those who sell domain names without providing domain name servers.<br/><br/>Additionally, a market like this is likely to have two other kinds of players.<br/><br/>There will be a few organizations who are willing to operate a server for free, perhaps for ideological reasons. Those servers will probably be overloaded and slow (like the free Usenet servers), but they act as a backstop which forces the commercial operators to provide something better.<br/><br/>There will also be a few commercial operators who provide enhanced super-fast servers without being generators. They will do this either because they have paying customers who want the best domain name service that is possible, or they will do it for their own business reasons (as Google does with their free-to-access domain name servers).<br/><br/>Here are the advantages of this simpler system:<br/><br/><ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><li>For the domain name owner, the registration is convenient, secure, and lasts forever,</li><li>For the internet user, the same set of domains is served to everyone,</li><li>For the generators, it's a worthwhile extra source of income, and</li><li>For the Bitcoin system, it's an easy way to get extra strength into the block chain with minimal extra data</li></ul></div>",

Other proposals envisioned a single new TLD like .bitdns.<br/></div><br/>This is like that, too. In this system, you're always registering a TLD. Even if I register \"theymos.btc\", I'm actually getting \"theymos.\". For better usability, though, BitDNS servers will make this a second-level domain by attaching a TLD like .bitdns or .btc to the registered name. The TLD in the registration is a suggestion for this: in this case, I'm suggesting that \"theymos.\" be followed by \"btc\" (though the server is free to ignore my suggestion).<br/><br/>The idea is to allow maximum market adaptability. Probably all servers will just use \".btc\" or whatever, and totally ignore the suggested value. As an example of something servers could do:<br/>- If your suggested domain suffix is com/org/etc., then your domain will actually overrule .com domains of the same domain for those few users who have configured BitDNS to do so.<br/>- Otherwise, \".btc\" is used.<br/><br/>It's a bad idea to hardcode any TLD into the spec. What if ICANN allocates .btc?<br/><br/>A later version might also look at the entire name+TLD for uniqueness.

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Hey guys.\u00a0 I'm really surprised that my post received so much attention!<br/><br/>And, I'm glad that BitDNS (or domain chain?) has generated this level excitement.<br/><br/>However, I urge you to re-read my initial post, as I feel that original formulation of the idea solves many of the problems you are currently discussing, including the (1) business-plan problem and (2) the bitcoin integration problem.\u00a0 There is also a third problem which hasn't been brought up by anyone thus far, which is (3) the problem of dividing the CPU pool among multiple block chains.<br/><br/>In the original formulation, bitDNS is simply an <i>example</i> of a possible generalization of bitcoin.\u00a0 It should be possible to dream up many such applications requiring block chains for systems that need some kind of quorum.<br/><br/><b>We should be discussing BitX</b>, the general block chain that in the future will support both bitcoin and bitDNS.\u00a0 It neatly solves (1) and (2), as well as the biggest problem in my view, the CPU pool division problem.<br/><br/>BitX is essentially an uber-chain which has hashes of app (bitcoin, bitDNS, ...) payloads as its payload.\u00a0 This way a bitDNS server will only need to download its own app payload without worrying about bitcoin's payload and vice-versa.\u00a0 As the number of bit-apps increase, this problem of smushing them all into bitcoin will only get worse, and (2) becomes a big problem that has to be solved for each app.\u00a0 BitX neatly deals with applications liberally, leaving it completely up to them to decide their own protocols but forming a valuable backbone for them.<br/><br/>With bitcoin and bitDNS as separate apps running on BitX, (1) is easily solved with third-party escrows.\u00a0 Escrowing is a big problem, and perhaps unsolveable, with respect to bitcoin and USD or PPUSD transactions, but it is incredibly reliable when executed between two bitapps.\u00a0 A trusted escrow can receive both transactions, verify them mechanically and automatically release the assets when both transactions are properly verified.<br/><br/>Note that this also frees bitDNS from bitcoin baggage when bitMoney overtakes bitcoin as the most popular bit-currency.\u00a0 I believe in fact that bitcoin in its present form will <i>necessarily</i> be overtaken due to problem (3).<br/><br/>The big deal: <b>the CPU pool division problem</b>.\u00a0 CPU division will occur when bitcoin can't or won't support bit-application bitFoo.\u00a0 This may occur with bitDNS, or it may occur later, but I think it will occur at some point.<br/><br/>Every miner for bitFoo will be one less miner for bitcoin and vice-versa.\u00a0 Both of these systems will be twice as susceptible to attack (if they have roughly equal CPU pools), and the problem multiplies as the number of bit-apps and their block chains increases.<br/><br/>BitX cleanly solves this by having every bit-app generate on the same block chain, the BitX chain.\u00a0 They weave their own block chains within the uber-chain, and unwittingly protect eachother from attack.\u00a0 It also greatly speeds adoption of any given bit-app; the BitX miners are already generating bitcoins, so why not generate bitDNS names as well?\u00a0 There is no cost to the miner, and who knows, this new-fangled bitDNS thing might actually take off someday?<br/><br/>Even if the demerits of separate block chains can be mitigated, the merits of a unified chain cannot be overstated in my view.<br/><br/>Finally, I hope that the name will remain BitDNS or BitNames, keeping the trend of revolutionary projects like bittorrent and bitcoin.\u00a0 There isn't any reason to call it domainchain if it is built upon BitX in any case, because the name registration aspect will be an implementation on top of the BitX chain rather than a full implementation with its own chain.<br/><br/>This separation of concerns makes BitX and bitDNS/bitcoin simple enough that I feel I can implement them myself if necessary, although slowly, in my spare time.\u00a0 I'm looking forward to some bit fun!<br/><br/>Thanks guys!</div>",

Here's what the latest changes mean:<br/><br/>1. If you register a domain name, you must connect to a miner that supports it (because standard clients won't relay your request). No problem. You will need to be using a modified client anyway (to give you a way to specify the domain name, the IP addresses and the fee) and the client can be designed to connect to known performant miners (which will probably be most of them).<br/><br/>2.

separate block chain for domain name registrations, and you want people to pay in Bitcoins.<br/></div><br/>Let's assume for a minute we have another block chain which contains just domain data which is cryptographically hashed, but may or may not have proof of work (let's ignore that for now, which I'll address below).\u00a0 The purpose of the block chain is for the authentication of the data primarily where the \"network\" of domain servers can \"certify\" that the data fits the network rules and that domain data within that chain is valid in terms of who \"owns\" what domain.\u00a0 As a public block chain, it also shows what the majority of the \"network\" agrees ought to be in that chain too.\u00a0 Improperly formatted data that is not agreed to by the majority of the network is rejected from this block.\u00a0 Since it is a chain it also verifies against tampering and does a timestamp, and more importantly by being outside of the main Bitcoin chain it reduces the data payload for what is admittedly a specialized service which not all Bitcion users are necessarily interested in.\u00a0 These are the features of the Bitcoin transaction database that are being desired to be applied to other sets of data.<br/><br/>So far that is the easy stuff.\u00a0 We also want to set up some system where the \"registrar\" putting data into this chain is going to be \"paid\" for the registration and authentication of this system.\u00a0 I emphasize this as this is both going to be a reason to be a registrar as to even exist as a registrar has a strong financial stake in maintaining the database to receive more registrations, and provides a reason to have fees to cut down on spamming domain names or abusing the public commons.\u00a0 The fees are being paid to maintain the database, which is the important thing here.\u00a0 Without this fee, at best this database is being authenticated and supplied to the world at large strictly as a public service for free.\u00a0 Some people like that but I hope that those involved with the Bitcoin project can appreciate how being paid for such a service can be very useful and motivating.\u00a0 The Theymos/Nanotube proposal and for that matter all registrations into the Bitcoin database through extra data in a transaction sidestep this issue entirely by ignoring authentication and only using the timestamp ability of Bitcoin, where this database would have to be built anyway but derived from Bitcoin and thus provided as a public service for free.<br/><br/>Here is the real issue, however:\u00a0 Since there is no central server, the registrant wants to make sure their registration is put in by whatever registrar happens to be in line to put in the next record onto the block chain, however that is decided (by proof of work or some other agreed upon system).\u00a0 They want to send out some sort of generic transaction that can be received by the \"authenticator\" of their registration application who puts this registration into that block chain.\u00a0 Only if their registration is accepted into the block chain should that authenticator be paid.<br/><br/>A problem arises here:\u00a0 A bitcoin miner may know that a fee is available from a registrant, but how do you decide where those coins properly belong?\u00a0 Keep in mind that once a fee is processed in Bitcoin, it is irreversible.\u00a0 If there is a chain split on the domain records due to a formatting/authentication dispute (it likely will happen just like it is happening with Bitcoin even now) those Bitcoin transactions may be going to an authenticator who in fact never did get the registration done because the majority of the network has ignored that domain registration block.\u00a0 Some other registrar may pick up the registration and simply out of the kindness of their heart decide to include it in another block, but they won't be receiving any fee at all for that service.\u00a0 Some system could be perhaps set up where after a block is down to a given depth in the block chain that the fee can be \"released\".\u00a0 Still, regardless of how you set this up there will be some trolls who will be collecting fees, pretending to put stuff into the domain registry but not really caring about the domain registry protocols and siphoning off the fees for themselves, perhaps in collaboration with a Bitcoin miner.\u00a0 Since this represents serious money, there will always be some trolls doing this.\u00a0 Even an \"honest\" registrar is still going to make some mistakes due to a bug or something similar which may on occasion capture fees when they are deserved under this system.<br/><br/>I believe the fee system is critical to the success of this domain registration system.\u00a0 That ensures selfish behavior on the part of the registrars which puts it into their self-interest to maintain the databases, computer equipment, and everything else which makes this work.\u00a0 Yes, there are other ways that a domain name server can earn some coins, and perhaps that ought to be done too, but registration fees are already a part of the marketplace and something which this system is trying to capture as well.<br/><br/>In short, I am trying to demonstrate here that the authentication simply must happen with an entirely different currency, or that authentication of the data (not merely the time stamping) must happen within the Bitcoin client and that data at least in some fashion or another included more directly into the Bitcion block chain with the data authenticated by the miner itself.\u00a0 A Bitcoin miner may choose not to process domain data, but some system must be set up that can certify that a given block <i>including the domain data</i> meets some sort of authentication standard to be accepted into the block chain to \"earn\" those registration fees.\u00a0 Otherwise the system falls apart and any talk of fees other than as a pure transaction fee to a Bitcoin miner alone is meaningless, with that transaction only to be used to preserve the transaction database.<br/><br/>I am also suggesting that to ensure promptness of registration, that it may also have to be a separate currency simply because not all miners are going to want to bother with domain registration authentication and over time the latency of even getting a domain registration into the system may be intolerably long (on the order of days or weeks) depending on the setup of the Bitcoin network and other priorities of the miners.\u00a0 I'm not suggesting an alternate currency to drive this project out of Bitcoin as useless data, but to point out that it is unworkable even from the perspective of the goals of the peer to peer domain server concept too.\u00a0 Putting the data into transactions isn't authentication and is also losing much of the power of what Bitcoin offers in terms of the authentication too.\u00a0 The proof of work system as used by Bitcion is also the only reasonable way to ensure that the system stays decentralized in terms of deciding who gets to put in the next block.\u00a0 Certainly some sort of common protocol for finding the next proof of work hash can be set up through a common mining pool between multiple currencies like this, but that is a completely separate issue from if it is to be a separate currency or not which I don't think has been decided on this thread.<br/><br/>The only other solution would be for Bitcoin to fully embrace this and other similar concepts that might come along and provide hooks and some sort of standard protocol to authenticate data of this nature on the main Bitcoin network.\u00a0 I think in theory that could be done and may be done in the more distant future in terms of \"unifying\" the proliferation of currencies that may result if it isn't done.\u00a0 I just don't see how that is going to get into the main Bitcoin chain anytime soon and even that has a whole bunch of drawbacks which I haven't fully explored either.</div>",

Keep in mind that once a fee is processed in Bitcoin, it is irreversible.\u00a0 If there is a chain split on the domain records due to a formatting/authentication dispute ... those Bitcoin transactions may be going to an authenticator who in fact never did get the registration done because the majority of the network has ignored that domain registration block<br/></div><br/>That doesn't really reflect how it works. If there is a chain split, eventually the network will settle on one of the chains. The generator that mined the block in the \"winning\" chain gets the transaction fee.<br/><br/>There is no \"irreversible\" payment to the generator in the \"losing\" chain. Well, in a sense it is irreversible but as they can only spend it in the losing chain it's not much use to them.<br/></div><br/>I think you got the context mixed up here.\u00a0 The reason why the payment is irreversible is because it is derived from a completely different chain.\u00a0 If there is a chain split in the domain registry chain, the fees spent as bitcoins (going into a completely different system) will have already been spent for those block in the \"losing\" chain.\u00a0 Transaction going into that \"losing block\" are essentially a wasted effort.<br/><br/>I'm suggesting that somebody simply sets up enough of the protocol to be able to appear to be following the domain processing rules so as to appear \"legit\", but they only have to make an appearance to get a block accepted.\u00a0 Perhaps they even get some blocks accepted, but then start to make up stuff or somebody attempts to register an existing name (as a scammer claiming they can hijack a domain from somebody else or however).\u00a0 If there is any reason why the rest of the network doesn't accept the block, for any reason, all of the fees collected by that \"miner\" or \"registrar\" would still be collected by that scammer regardless of if it actually gets into the chain.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the block being \"authenticated\" is a part of the same chain that creates the currency, this isn't a problem.\u00a0 If the blocks get rejected by the network, any fees (set up in a system like how transaction fees are done with Bitcoin) are also similarly rejected by the network too.\u00a0 Any chain splits remove any fees paid to \"losing\" blocks and therefore can be ignored.\u00a0 This is why the authentication must happen in the same chain as the transaction.\u00a0 Either that is in Bitcoin or a parallel currency, but if it is with Bitcoin, the authentication must happen within the Bitcoin network too.\u00a0 Otherwise, there isn't a way to get payment to the miner with an outside currency that is similar to Bitcoin without fraud and a significant attack on the payment system.\u00a0 This is fraud because a service is being claimed and paid for, but the service isn't being rendered.<br/><br/>Hacking the data into Bitcoin transactions does not perform authentication of the data and pushes that need somewhere else.\u00a0 In effect, it permits \"double spending\" of a domain name or allocation of a domain name to more than one person with ambiguity over who actually owns that domain.</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">It seems like killing two birds with one stone isn\u0092t enough on the bitcoin forum; one has to kill three.<br/><br/>Firstly, I would like to commend nanotube's+theymos proposal. \u00a0I like it because it makes economic sense, and it is simple.<br/>The design that I am proposing in this post is backwards compatible with nanotube's+theymos proposal, however solves all the \u0091issues\u0092 said. (I still think there is really nothing wrong about how it is proposed to work as it is. \u00a0However, if there is a better way of doing it, why not?)<br/><br/>Before we start, one must state that domain names a fundamentally different to currency, as they obtain their value in a very different manner; currency obtains values from being something that has restricted supply. \u00a0Domain names, rather have values from the quality of the name, i.e. a short dictionary word has more value that a long random sequence.<br/><br/>If a restriction of the total number of domain names is made, it would be an arbitrary restriction, causing a lower efficiency market, thus reducing the attractiveness of using that market.<br/>So with this in mind, lets design a system that can have an unlimited number of domain names; providing people are willing to pay for the service of claiming the domain name.<br/><br/><br/>The main concern on the forum is the inclusion of \u0091other data\u0092 in the block chain; the problem isn\u0092t a fundamental one, as the bitcoin transactions block chain is indeed data in its own right.<br/>In discussions elsewhere, it has been shown that:<br/>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Generators will happily include any data that is profitable to include.<br/>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The block size will grow to a size that balances data demands and the profitably of the miners.<br/>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clients only need to \u0091keep\u0092 data that they interested in. \u00a0Data that is irrelevant to the client may be forgotten once processed.<br/>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Transaction balances may be used to cull the chain of old transactions.<br/>Therefore it has already been shown that the amount of data in the chain is not an issue with: generation (they get paid for it), or storage (they only keep what they want). \u00a0The only outstanding issue is: transfers.<br/><br/>What has been discussed is that every client must download the entire block chain (before it is culled) then, every new block generated and check it. \u00a0Only after processing may a client delete any data that it doesn\u0092t want. \u00a0This accounts for a small amount of work while the chain is small, however the fear is when large amounts of irrelevant data (to any particular client) is included in the chain this task will become overly taxing.<br/><br/><br/>I propose, a design hinted at by Satoshi, to solve this problem: \u00a0Split bitcoin transactions into multiple groups.<br/>While keeping the important tie between data and bitcoin transactions, (every bit of data still must include it\u0092s compensation to the miners as a bitcoin transaction fee).<br/>Group the transactions by templates. \u00a0For example: \u00a0Put the \u0091vanilla template\u0092 bitcoin transactions into the vanilla group, the \u0091bitdns template\u0092 bitcoin transactions into the bitdns group, the \u0091bitpgp template\u0092 bitcoin transactions into the bitpgp group, and so on.<br/><br/>Finally include a \u0091summary\u0092 group that contains only the changes to the transaction balances accumulated in all the other groups.<br/><br/>A Block could contain something like this:<br/><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"userimg\" src=\"https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcointalk.org%2Findex.php%3Faction%3Ddlattach%3Btopic%3D1790.0%3Battach%3D645&amp;t=589&amp;c=rDK5ZycD76KvUA\"/><br/><br/>Once one block has confirmed the previous block (checking that all the accounting is correct in the summary block), only downloading the merkle tree and the summary group is required to keep up2date about the changes. \u00a0This is in-effect less data than is required to download now! If the client decides that it needs some in-particular bit of data from one of the other groups after checking the summary, it can optionally download that also.<br/><br/>The important thing to notice is it that there is no free lunch, every bit of data must still include the appropriate transaction fees, in bitcoins.<br/><br/><br/>Nanotube and Teymos\u0092s design fits very nicely on top of this design, as the transactions that the BitDNS system makes will simply be automatically grouped by the template that the generators use to check the BitDNS transactions before accepting them. Allowing clients to download the BitDNS data if they want it, or just download the transaction summaries.<br/></div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">After reading through this whole thread, I've got a couple of comments that I think would be helpful:<br/><br/>1)\u00a0 Everyone in the thread seems intent on replacing the entire DNS infrastructure in one fell swoop, which I think is the wrong approach.\u00a0 The real problem with the DNS system as it exists today is that somebody has to own the root.\u00a0 At the end of the day, you have to trust ICANN.\u00a0 What the DomainChain/BitDNS system should strictly focus on is establishing ownership of domain names.\u00a0 All it needs to track is that the holder of Key A owns domain foo.bar.\u00a0 Once we've established this shared trust, we can support many different DNS infrastructures that can be implemented independently from this project.\u00a0 Whatever new systems are created use DomainChain/BitDNS to establish which key owns the domain, and only allows that individual to insert records for that domain.\u00a0 This works out well, since all participants in the system can validate that the record they've looked up is valid.\u00a0 Right now it is easy to get bogged down in all the details of managing DNS records, when all we need to do is establish a trusted, distributed authority that can form the root of DNSSEC, some new p2p DNS, or whatever.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking this could be used to solve the CA problem with HTTPS, since signing your certificate with the same key would prove that I've reached the correct server.\u00a0 But I digress...<br/><br/>2)\u00a0 Limiting the TLDs should be a requirement.\u00a0 If this system doesn't inter-operate with the existing DNS infrastructure by preventing name collisions, it will undermine the trust you are trying to generate.\u00a0 Even I'm not sure I'm ready to sign up for a distributed DNS system if someone new can pick up <a href=\"http://www.mylocalbank.com\">www.mylocalbank.com</a> and cause havok.\u00a0 I'd humbly suggest .web as the TLD to use, but anything will work as long as it is short and not currently in use.<br/><br/>Right now the focus should be on getting this up and running in a way that doesn't conflict with the existing system.\u00a0 If this system becomes dominant at some point and needs to tackle additional TLDs, that is a \"problem\" that can be dealt with then.<br/><br/>3)\u00a0 Personally, I think expiring domain names are the way to go.\u00a0 Even with relatively expensive renewals today, there is still a ton of junk out there.\u00a0 I can't imagine how bad it would be if you owned a domain forever.\u00a0 It isn't asking much to say that you have to renew your domain periodically to keep it, especially since this shouldn't be the ripoff that the existing system is today.<br/><br/>I'd like to close out by saying that this is really exciting stuff.\u00a0 I've read a number of different ideas about how to solve the DNS problem, and this is the first one I've seen that could actually solve it (and not just replace ICANN with pick-your-new-benevolent-dictator).</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">What is Bitcoin? A decentralized way to keep track of ownership of a fixed quantity of things.<br/><br/>The DNS problem is a specific example of a more general functionality: keeping track of ownership of a fixed quantity of things, <b>where each member of the set is distinguishable</b>.<br/><br/>It turns out that bitcoins are already distinguishable. They are well ordered, mathematically speaking, so a number can be assigned to every bitcoin, for example 0 to 21 million.<br/><br/>So, for a DNS functionality, this is all we need to do:<br/>1. create a second coinbase, possibly forked from the main coinbase (bitcoin)<br/>2. interpret each coin in the second coinbase as a well-defined interval of the sha256 hash space of all DNS names.<br/><br/>Ownership of DNS names is therefore determined by which coins in the second coinbase you own.<br/><br/>Some months ago I was opposed to adding DNS stuff to the existing bitcoin network protocol and client, because I argued bitcoin should stay true to its limited purpose. However, thinking more about this now I support inclusion of additional coinbases / tracking systems in the main network. The reason for doing this is so as not to water down CPU power into multiple networks. We want one strong network, so the network should be versatile.<br/><br/>In fact, maybe anyone should be able to create a new coinbase on the main network, and specify rules such as quantity and distribution rate. In the case of DNS, everyone will just have to agree that a particular coinbase is to be interpreted as the DNS rights to different parts of the sha256 hash space for the DNS names.<br/><br/>I agree with the idea put forth by da2ce7, which he says is derived from an idea put forth by Satoshi. I think it is compatible with my idea of allowing arbitrary creation of new coinbases on the same network.<br/><br/>I cannot find the nanotube+theymos proposal so i cannot comment on it.</div>",
