        "content": "<div class=\"post\">SVN rev 163 (ver 0.3.13.3) has the key pool feature. \u00a0Pre-generated new keys are aged in a queue before use, so that backups of wallet.dat hold keys you'll use in the future.<br/><br/>For now I made the default pool size 100. \u00a0It can be configured with -keypool=. \u00a0Be aware, it takes a little time to increase the pool size, so don't go crazy with it. \u00a0Disk space is about 1K per key.<br/><br/>I have not addressed the recovery side of this yet. \u00a0If you actually did restore an old wallet.dat, I think you may have to delete blk*.dat to rediscover your own transactions during the redownload.<br/><br/>I've only tested this moderately. \u00a0You might not want to use this for a website server until it's had some more testing.</div>",
