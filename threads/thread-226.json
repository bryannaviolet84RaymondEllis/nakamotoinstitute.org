Instead of writing a 'proxy' app you can use SSH to tunnel. For example, if your bitcoin instance is running on 'example.com' and that machine is running an ssh server, you can tunnel to it from another machine with:<br/><br/>ssh -N example.com -L\u00a0 9481:localhost:9481<br/><br/>Now you can use the RPC interface on your local machine to port 9481 and it will be tunnelled over an encrypted SSH session to the machine running the bitcoin RPC server.<br/><br/>You want to encrypt the connection because the JSON-RPC password is sent in clear text (it's actually base 64 encoded but basically it's the equivalent of clear text).</div>",

That said, i'd prefer to have an official release.
