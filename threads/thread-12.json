        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I haven't tried compiling 64-bit yet. 64-bit wouldn't make it any faster, since it uses 64-bit numbers in only a few places and SHA-256 is a 32-bit algorithm, but it may be convenient for those running a 64-bit OS. If I get a chance I'll try -m64 and see what the problem is.<br/><br/>You can run the 32-bit version on 64-bit Linux by installing ia32-libs. \u00a0(sudo apt-get install ia32-libs) \u00a0If we made a Debian package, it could automatically pull that in as a dependency.</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">All modern computers are amd64/EM64T. It should be able to be compiled on either platform. It is a hassle to compile all of the dependancies in 32-bit mode just to run one program. I know the 32-bit/64-bit stuff is seamless on windows platforms but on *NIX platforms it is a major pain since they are usually either one or the other by default. <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/><br/><br/>As a workaround I am in the process of compiling FreeBSD 32-bit jails (aka virtual server images) just for running bitcoin on our network. It should make it easier for me to deploy more nodes as they can simply be zipped up / scp'd / extracted / launched. After I have a working system image based on FreeBSD-8.0 I may post a link for download.<br/><br/>Thanks and keep up the good work. I can't wait to see how many exchangers are willing to trade BT. The stability of the exchangers and their longevity is everything. If the exchangers stick around big businesses may use this system to get around service fees / chargebacks / and the general faults caused by the credit card industry.<br/><br/>Keep up the great work! <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/><br/></div>",
