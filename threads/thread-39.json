        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I'm currently trying to get BitCoin to compile on the openSuse Build Service, which would allow us to create a wide range of precompiled packages for a variety of distros but I'm continually running into problems. The most important of them is the wxWidgets 2.9.0 requirement which is incredibly hard to provide, and the source of many of the problems described on the Forum. Why is it so important to have a 2.9.0? Looking through the source of 2.8.10 it appears that unicode is possible with that version too.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>cdecker</div>",
