Sending 0 coins is also not possible.<br/><br/>If you want to track payments, you can give a new Bitcoin address to each customer. How to make a new address: Options -&gt; Change your address. We could perhaps make this easier by adding next to \"Send Coins\" a button \"Receive Coins\", which would create you the new address and ask for its label.</div>",
