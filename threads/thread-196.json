BUT... there's no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater and I firmly believe that the current wxWidgets interface should be maintained until such a time as something superior comes along.<br/><br/>My personal feeling is that whilst separate daemon/GUI binaries can work, it also tends to be messy, I'd be far more in favour of having the core code and then separate source that you compile with it according to your target OS, that way everything is still a single binary and can be integrated as idealistically as possible.<br/><br/>To put this in practice, imagine 3 SVN trunks; the first is BitCoin core, the other two are LINGUI and WINGUI - the latter two being dependant on code from the first.</div>",

I can't see why.<br/></div><br/>Bitcoin is a P2P network, so the program should be running all the time. However, I don't need to be looking at a GUI all that time, so it makes sense to have a daemon. Currently, you have to stop the daemon when you want to start the GUI version, which breaks the network for a moment.<br/><br/>Some P2P applications like aMule do this properly. The daemon is running all the time, and when you want to interact with it, you start the separate GUI, which connects to the daemon. Most importantly, the GUI can run on a different machine from the daemon.<br/><br/>Such a setup would be great for mobile Bitcoin usage. You run the daemon on your \"server\" machine, and you connect to it with a GUI on your mobile device. I think this has been already discussed in a different context, but the same mechanism applies.<br/><br/>However, you can already use the JSON-RPC mechanism to build a separate GUI, so there is no immediate need to change the mainline client. </div>",
