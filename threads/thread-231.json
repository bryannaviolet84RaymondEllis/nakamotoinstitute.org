It's dominated by specialists who have access to wholesale means of production and secret, proprietary GPU code.<br/><br/>The average user no longer has a fighting chance and has given up generating blocks altogether.<br/><br/>What does this remind me of? That's right, bitcoin is becoming like the physical money economy, where a small number of central banks now guarantee the trustworthiness of paper money.<br/><br/>There are two problems: One, the possibility of market manipulation, and more importantly, if only a handful of people do most of the proof of work, what is the point of a decentralized currency in the first place? It weakens us, because a powerful attacker would only need to bribe a few people to gain more than 50% of khash/s.<br/><br/>To stop this, I suggest the following:<br/><br/>1) Add more hash functions that must be solved in addition to SHA-2. The more, the better. The function ecosystem should include functions with very different requirements, eg. some that require lots of memory, some that can't be paralellized, some that require lots of disk space,...<br/>Also, function parameters that change randomly every time difficulty changes. This would take away some advantage from people who are highly specialized at solving just one hash function.<br/><br/>2) Pooled block generation. For instance, if 100 users join a pool and one block is solved, the 50 coins are distributed among those users. This would encourage amateur users to start generating again.</div>",

Realize that the hardware needed to stand a chance of generating isn't all that cutting edge or expensive. Any mid-level gamer machine has the engine to put out 20 or 30 million hashes/sec, at least. The real issue is software, as this gives the owner of such software a huge advantage for a very small price, thus people will obviously take advantage of this as long as possible.<br/><br/>I feel stupid, really.

Hashing more data is slower than hashing less data, so the block header is critically of a fixed size for everyone, with one exception. After every hash attempt, you increment the Nonce header field, but since this field is only 32 bytes long, it overflows a lot. Whenever it overflows, you increment the variable-size extraNonce field. The larger extraNonce gets, the slower generating will get. It doesn't get significantly large with normal incrementing, though.<br/><br/>If you have a lot of computers and they're all working on the same block with the same public key, then they're all very likely to be hashing the same block at the same time, which is pointless. To fix this, each computer is given a unique extraNonce modifier value. This might be very large to prevent collisions, and it therefore slows down hashing.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly you could design a pooling system without this flaw, but it'd be more difficult.<br/><br/>I see that m0mchil's getwork is doing something with extraNonce. I don't know how bad that implementation is, but it theoretically <i>must</i> be slower than a client without it (all things being equal; clearly adding GPU support will improve performance).</div>",

To fix this, each computer is given a unique extraNonce modifier value. This might be very large to prevent collisions, and it therefore slows down hashing.<br/></div><br/>In a centralized system, the server could simply keep a list of extraNonces in active use and give out the lowest free one.\u00a0 Then you would avoid collisions without requiring more than one unique extraNonce per client.\u00a0 A 3-byte extraNonce would be sufficient for millions of clients.\u00a0 Note that clients of realistic performance do not really need the extraNonce to handle nonce overflow today, since such overflows happen less frequently than the periodic nTime updates (but this is not considered by the standard client today, which updates the extraNonce more liberally).</div>",
