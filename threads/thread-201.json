Put the messaging system on IRC on the UI, make the UI smart enough to stop, block, maim, impair the server running beneath it if certain messages signed with certain keys appear. But DON'T make the server respond to anything outside local GUI control, just because that is too dangerous and in the end does more harm than good.<br/><br/>This way, average users will have the upgrade notices and the generators stopped and whatnot when needed, but those of us running services over bitcoin will not loose shop because of that. Also, if the key gets compromised, the network still runs without worries, and a simple GUI change will unblock everyone.<br/><br/>For server admins, why not a mailing list for update announces?

Of course it is a good idea but it should be enabled ONLY when specifically requested by the user. It should be opt-in as opposed to opt-out. There is a huge difference between the two (ask Facebook). If it's going to be enabled by default it is going to be perceived by many as an exploitable/malicious feature counting on the fact that most people will not realize/notice it is even there. And I wouldn't say these concerns wouldn't be justified ...

When it is enabled by default a lot of people may not even realize this \"feature\" is enabled and perceive remote disabling as a breach of trust ... I know I would if I wasn't aware of that possibility and the software would suddenly stopped working and I would discover it was disabled by remote by someone I gave no conscious permission to do so.<br/><br/>I hope you'll consider this suggestion ... thanks</div>",

Many people are going to just notice there is a new version, download and install it never realizing this new remote control was inserted there.<br/><br/>Saying that they can examine the source code or that it was openly discussed on the forum is like Facebook saying \"but we have an option to delete your account, it's in terms of service, section 76, line 346, under link named so-appalling-that-nobody-would-ever-click-it, then on page 2, just solve the capcha, confirm the dialog, that will disable your account and if you do not log in in a week it will be deleted\". In short ... nobody actually does it ... that's how badware behaves and I do not want for Bitcoin to be badware.<br/><br/>If there is a remote safety disable function every user who has it enabled should consciously enable it knowing what it does. This can be easily accomplished by presenting a dialog urging user to enable it while explaining what it does in a GUI client and presenting a warning accomplishing the same task when daemon is run. Simple, efficient and everybody is happy. That's how software that respects its users and is working for them should behave. I'm sure most people would enable it when understanding what it does ... but sneaking this feature in without making sure the user specifically wants it there is making decisions for the user, I do not like decisions being made for me <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/><br/><br/>I'm aware of this because I read the forums but what in the future? (And what about people who do not read forums) Will there be another \"feature\" inserted and I'm not going to be even notified, explained what it does and asked if I want it enabled? I do not like that if you ask me ... I want to know what software on my CPU does, if it doesn't make reasonable effort to inform me of that and assure that I'm aware of it's behavior I would consider it badware.<br/><br/>That's at least my perspective ... and the fix is extremely easy <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/></div>",
