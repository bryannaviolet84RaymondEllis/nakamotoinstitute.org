Also, on a 'paranoid' note it's not 'anonymous' to send a 'franked' envelope, revealing your location and which also contains your DNA. <img alt=\"Shocked\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/shocked.gif\"/><br/><br/>Not that this is a realistic consideration for micro payments anyway.

After all, the people already accepting LR/Pecunix are very like-minded.<br/><br/>Yes, we are all here to learn and discuss. My apologies if I came across as a \"know-it-all\". I have just been in the payment processing industry and law studies for over 10 years, and I know a lot about it. <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/><br/><br/>Sure, you can be worried about me taking your DNA from an envelope that you send. <img alt=\"Tongue\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/tongue.gif\"/> Just use gloves when preparing the envelope and use water or tape instead of saliva. (Wear a hair net too if you are that paranoid! ha!)<br/><br/>A franked envelope has information about the general area from where the letter was mailed. It is rather useless to an investigator, assuming that you don't use a real return address. Or you use a return address that I provide you (lets just say). You can also go for a little drive to a different part of town and mail from there. Or another city. Or get a friend to re-mail it from his city. There are plenty of options.<br/><br/>'Snail mail' when properly prepared (making the envelopes as machine-readable as possible and using the proper Zip code 5+4 digit extension, etc) is actually quite speedy.

After all, the people already accepting LR/Pecunix are very like-minded.<br/><br/>Yes, we are all here to learn and discuss. My apologies if I came across as a \"know-it-all\". I have just been in the payment processing industry and law studies for over 10 years, and I know a lot about it. <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/><br/><br/>Sure, you can be worried about me taking your DNA from an envelope that you send. <img alt=\"Tongue\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/tongue.gif\"/> Just use gloves when preparing the envelope and use water or tape instead of saliva. (Wear a hair net too if you are that paranoid! ha!)<br/><br/>A franked envelope has information about the general area from where the letter was mailed. It is rather useless to an investigator, assuming that you don't use a real return address. Or you use a return address that I provide you (lets just say). You can also go for a little drive to a different part of town and mail from there. Or another city. Or get a friend to re-mail it from his city. There are plenty of options.<br/><br/>'Snail mail' when properly prepared (making the envelopes as machine-readable as possible and using the proper Zip code 5+4 digit extension, etc) is actually quite speedy. (I have experience with shipping as well.)<br/><br/></div><br/>No. You don't come across as a 'know-it-all'. I enjoy reading your post and contributions.<br/><br/>However, I would much rather just sit at my desk and transfer 'payments' around by text msg etc. than have to drive across town to post a letter. Only to return home and remember that I'd forgotten to buy the darn hair nets (again) rofl.<br/><br/>Google Paper has experience of shipping to <a href=\"http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html\">http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html</a></div>",

I guarantee that fact.<br/><br/>See 'jurisdiction' again. Is PayPal a registered corporation? I'd imagine so. Obtaining a corporate charter is a PRIVILEGE (means \"private law\"), not a right. (Rights are inherent, you don't apply for them.) It makes PayPal subject to the jurisdiction of the REGISTRAR. (The state or federal government.) So when they are asked for your information and are stuffed with a pile of statutes, they have to comply or face civil (See: Roman Civil Law) penalties or the revocation of the charter. (Revocation of charters is rare, but it does happen.)<br/><br/>After PayPal gives up your information; they (IRS/boogieman/whoever) will look at the real world items you have in your 'keep' and determine that they were paid for with these so-called donations online.<br/><br/>You'll enter your plea with the courts (a plea is a verbal contract that also establishes civil jurisdiction with your consent), they'll find you guilty, and you'll get a nice piece of paper called a court order to pay fines (or possibly jail time).<br/><br/>Call me jaded if you wish.
