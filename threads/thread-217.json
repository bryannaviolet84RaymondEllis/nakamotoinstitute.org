        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I have an unusual configuration: on my headless gateway there is bitcoind running and on my desktop standart bitcoin is running (both Linux OpenSuSE, gateway 11.1, desktop 11.3, bitcoin 0.3.12 both). TCP port 8333 forwarded on gateway to the desktop (so gateway client can't has incoming connections). I don't know why but when I start desktop client after gateway's one the desktop client can't connect and flickers between 0 and 2 connections for a long time. Eventually it may connect but while it can't the memory leaks badly. About 200Kb/sec (each 0-2 change). It may not be noticed if the client connects instantly but in my case it doesn't. If I start first the desktop and then the headless client (after the desktop one has connected) everything is fine and no leaks (or they are little enough). I guess there is unfreed memory in bootstrap function or somewhere in the bootstrap process.</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Hmm, now the bug is gone though I remember how it was. That's the compiled release binary, 0.3.12 as I already mentioned. I didn't use -connect. Flickering was fast from 0 to 2 (less than half second) and then there was a pause in about a second with 0 connections. So the flicker itself was almost every second (not faster). Looks like it got connrefused instantly or such. I watched logs, sorry didn't saved them but there was nothing interesting just connect and disconnect without a reason.<br/><br/>I measured the RES memory with htop. It updates once per second that's why I can't see the real leak speed. Now the client tries to connect after startup and flickers 0-2, too, but just 5-10 times and then establishes one connection. Then it flickers between 1 and 3 and no leaks happen. Then connection number grows up to 40 or even more, everything is stable. To reproduce this try to switch off the network connection right after the client gets IPs from IRC so it will try to connect and fail.</div>",
