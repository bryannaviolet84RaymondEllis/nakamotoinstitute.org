For example: I could run BT within TOR-land on a .onion address. A client could connect their BT to TOR and have it seed from a .onion address and use it as a connected peer. (Likewise for I2P: someone could run a .i2p service that is -- well -- BC).<br/><br/>I might setup a couple of nodes in this fashion and post the tunnels on this forum. I already run a lot of I2P and TOR nodes so adding BC to the mix is quite trivial.<br/><br/>I support the idea of making BC compatible with TOR and I2P to increase the privacy of the system. I mean: why re-invent the wheel? There are thousands of mix network nodes just sitting there that can be used to enhance BC. <img alt=\"Cheesy\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/cheesy.gif\"/><br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/></div>",

You just need to limit the connectivity with slow servers and only use the fastest nodes where possible. I also like to block any nodes in 'problem' internet countries, which also tend to have slower connectivity, this also increases overall privacy somewhat. I also block Unnamed, ididnteditheconfig, any servers that I don't like the name of and unstable servers.<br/><br/>This config. example is only good for non-relay / non-exit personal use.

At first I assumed that this was because Tor exits might be blocking port 8333 or 6667, but that is mostly not the case !<br/><br/>Other P2P applications through Tor can 'ignore' IP addresses that they cannot connect to and the application can still get the job done without 'warning'. However, Bitcoin <i>must</i> try to connect with all nodes to check its not missing any blocks ! So, if an IP range where only 1 Bitcoin node is running is blocking Tor exit nodes, then presumably this will always be the case ?<br/><br/>This is problematic for many reasons. <img alt=\"Huh\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/huh.gif\"/></div>",
