        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I've been working on a project inspired by a suggestion (and the offer of bounty <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/> ) over from <a href=\"http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=39.msg2065#msg2065\">another thread</a>. I thought I should stop derailing that thread and start my own project thread.<br/><br/>Basically, the idea of the project is an easy way for websites to integrate bitcoin payment. How it works is the user runs a website on their local machine, which is only accessible to them, then when the shop wants a user to pay some money, they simply send them to this local site, which handles sending the money and then redirects back to the shop site to finish the transaction.<br/><br/>So at the moment, I have a test of this running on my PC, visiting this URL:<br/><br/><a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8080/BitcoinSalepoint/LandingPage?continue=\">http://127.0.0.1:8080/BitcoinSalepoint/LandingPage?continue=</a><b><a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\">http://www.google.co.uk</a></b>&amp;paymentname=testaddress&amp;address=<b>1DoMXge6kToHZN8m4B2my43anCPbD4rJgE</b>&amp;amount=<b>0.25</b><br/><br/>will simply send 0.25BC to my laptop from my PC, and then redirect me to google.<br/><br/>My todo list:<br/>-&gt; Add some stylesheets for prettiness<br/>-&gt; Add a confirm/deny button<br/>-&gt; Add a way to communicate to the shop if the transaction succeeded or failed (mostly done)<br/>-&gt; Look into packaging the program up into a simple executable which you can run instead of bitcoin, and it will run in the background and kill itself when the bitcoin process dies.<br/><br/>Suggestions <span style=\"font-size: 2pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;\">(and donations)</span> very welcome <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/></div>",

So easy for a trojan to wipe out a user's wallet.<br/><br/>If this feature were embedded directly within Bitcoin, there would be no need to open the JSON API, and security measures could be taken (such as a captcha to be entered before a pay could be fired, or a password).<br/><br/>I am not, however, a security expert.
