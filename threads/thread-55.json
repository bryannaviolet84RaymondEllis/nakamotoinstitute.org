It doesn't seem to have any problems creating or removing icons, but I'm using XFCE, so that might be the difference.<br/><br/>In addition, there's a difference between standard behaviour for tray icons in Windows and Linux. In most Linux apps, clicking the tray button while the app's window is open will cause it to close again. I personally like that better than the Windows default, where a single click does nothing once the main window is displayed. Is there any chance that feature might get added to the Linux version?</div>",
