Run sha1sum on the file you want to timestamp. Convert the result to a Bitcoin address, such as via <a href=\"http://blockexplorer.com/q/hashtoaddress\">http://blockexplorer.com/q/hashtoaddress</a> . Then send a small payment to that address.<br/><br/>The money will be lost forever, as there is no way to spend it further, but the timestamp Bitcoin address will remain in the block chain as a record of the file's existence.<br/><br/>I understand that this is arguably not a good use of the Bitcoin distributed database, but nothing stops people from doing this so we should be aware that it may be done.<br/></div></div>",
