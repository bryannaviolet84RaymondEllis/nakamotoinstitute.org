I'm on bitcoin for few weeks and didn't find block yet (I'm mining on three CPUs). When many people have slow CPUs and they mining separately, each of them compete among themselves AND against rich GPU bastards ;-), because everybody counts sha256 hashes from the same range. Two separate CPUs with 1000khash/s isn't the same as one 2000khash/s machine!. But new feature of the official bitcoin client called 'getwork' now enables work of many computers together, so they don't compete. Because there is now standalone CPU miner (thanks to jgarzik!) and 'getwork' patch is in official client now, I have an idea:<br/><br/><b>Join poor CPU miners to one cluster and increase their chance to find a block!</b><br/><br/>How that should work? There will be web page where you can register, enter your wallet address and get URL and your personal rpcuser/rpcpassword for your CPU/GPU miners. When you start own miner with these credentials, server will send you work which was not calculated yet by other members of cluster.<br/><br/>But when your client find winning hash, you do not get full reward for block (50BTC right now), but only proportional part, which you calculate. When you offer 1000khash/s for one day and whole cluster performance will be 20000khash/s and it takes two days to find a block, your reward will be (50/20/2=)1.25BTC.<br/><br/>Advantages? When you have poor standalone computer, you need to wait many weeks or even months for finding full 50BTC reward. When you join cluster like this, you will constantly receive small amount of bitcoins every day or week (depends on full cluster performance).<br/><br/>Disadvantages? You need to trust in central authority (me) that I don't steal block for myself. But I'm goofing around for few week and I'm amazed with bitcoin idea, so I don't plan to steal anybody right now :-).<br/><br/><del>Another possible problem is that somebody will ask for new work very often, but in fact he will not count real hashes. In this case it will look like he has very strong CPU and he should get big part of reward if cluster find a block. But there is a simple defense against cheaters: Central server sometimes send work which leads to 'winning' hash. Worker which don't return this hash as matching will be permanently banned (login/password and IP address).</del> This was succesfully solved by letting miners calculate proof-of-work. It is not anymore possible to be a part of cluster and not count hashes.<br/><br/>Are you interested in?</div>",

If nothing else as part of an experiment to make your software more secure. There is another thread already on the forum for the source code to Cooperative Mining but I am not sure that it was complete or successful. There appeared several people participating but no additional work from them. Perhaps it was so successful that they no longer wish to have additional participants into their group- I am unsure. My rate contribution may not win me blocks by myself but as a larger group hopefully I could be helpful. Please let me know if you move forward with this. </div>",

But if I'm wrong, no-one has posted a specific objection. So I'll try to explain it again, by presenting a specific design to show that a dishonest client cannot cheat.<br/><br/>Suppose I operate a pooled mining server, and I recruit some clients who wish to pool their mining.<br/><br/>My server asks each client to do some hashing for it. It asks each client to submit any hashes they find that are above a certain threshold of difficulty. The server chooses a difficulty that is one-fortieth (1/40th) of the current \"official\" difficulty level.<br/><br/>My server gets a constant trickle of candidate hashes sent back by the remote mining clients. Every now and then, one of those hashes meets the official difficulty level and my server can generate a block, which earns my server 50 bitcoins.<br/><br/>I now distribute bitcoins to the remote mining clients, at the rate of one bitcoin for each hash that was submitted for the current block that was at or above 1/40th of the official difficulty level.<br/><br/>In the long run, I would expect to distribute 40 coins out of every 50 that my server generates, although there will be some fluctuation from block to block. Nothing in this scheme requires the clients to be honest, because there is no way that a dishonest client can cheat!<br/><br/>The client is calculating hashes that will generate 50 BTC for <b>my</b> server. Those same hashes are not of any use to a dishonest client. They cannot be used to generate 50 BTC for the dishonest client, because a different hash code is needed to encode the payment of the generated bitcoins to someone else. And if the dishonest client tries to cheat by generating hashes that will pay the generated bitcoins to themselves, then the hash codes they submit won't validate at my server and I won't distribute any share of the payouts to them.<br/><br/>So this scheme requires absolutely no trust of the client.<br/><br/>This scheme also does not require the mining client to have faith that the server is honest. If the server advertises that it is paying out 1BTC for each hash that is at least 1/40th of the official difficulty level, then every client that submits an \"easy\" hash for a block that was generated can check that they received their bitcoin. Any fraud would show up immediately.</div>",

It asks each client to submit any hashes they find that are above a certain threshold of difficulty. The server chooses a difficulty that is one-fortieth (1/40th) of the current \"official\" difficulty level.<br/></div><br/>One of the potential problems I can see is that you may have to tweak the \"reduced\" difficulty level in some way so that it really is about a 1 in 40 chance of getting a successful hash.\u00a0 It would seem to me that a reduction of even a couple of bits in the expected hash would have major consequences in terms of how many \"reduced difficulty hashes\" are created and it is possible that reducing the difficulty to 1/40th of the \"official\" difficulty level may create many more \"successful\" reduced difficulty hashes than 40, perhaps even to a higher order of magnitude.\u00a0 This is something to test with a successful experiment of this idea to see just how it might turn out.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it is also going to be random in terms of how many reduced hashes are going to be created per successful hash cycle, as you are dealing with probability here and not mathematical certainty in terms of how many are going to be generated by the \"farm\" even if it does produce in this example on average about 40 \"reduced difficulty hashes\".\u00a0 It may still be worth the effort if it turns out that on average that is all you have to spend for an increase in successful blocks created, but it will be some blocks where the hash farm server makes a bunch of coins for the server operator and other times it may be at least temporarily a loss.<br/><br/>Another potential problem I also see is if you happen to be requesting hashes where you've received a couple dozen reduced hashes and then the network has a huge spike in difficulty.\u00a0 This is a potential liability issue so far as the \"owner\" of the hash farm server is concerned, as it would substantially impact the \"profit margin\".\u00a0 Think of it this way:\u00a0 If the current difficulty is at say 800 and you've received 30 hashes with a difficulty level of 20 (1/40th of the difficulty, as you suggested here), then the difficulty increases to 1600, it is very likely that you may have to plow through another 30-40 hashes at the new higher difficulty level of 40 before you get a successful block into the chain mining the coins.\u00a0 If in this example you are still paying out 1 BTC per reduced hash, it could get very costly for the person running the hash farm in this case.\u00a0 It may wipe out any profit earned and certainly is another potential liability issue to think about.\u00a0 I'd have to think through the statistical probability on an increase of difficulty some more in terms of giving some hard numbers, but it is something that should be accounted for.<br/><br/>Then again, difficulty could drop brining in at least statistically more money to the server operator.\u00a0 The current tendency is for increases of difficulty, however.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I think the basic concept as outlined here is pretty sound and would tend to work rather well.\u00a0 Almost too well as I could see this being put into a botnet and having the computers in the botnet be sending back potential hashes without having to worry about any payments.\u00a0 Network bandwidth would be trivial and almost unnoticed, and you could even \"throttle\" the CPU bandwidth or throw it onto the GPU instead.\u00a0 I have no doubt that eventually somebody is going to build one of these botnets if it hasn't already been built for Bitcoins.</div>",

The server operator only pays out to easy hashes that were submitted for a block that is won. There's no payout for easy hashes that were submitted for a block that someone else generates.<br/><br/>The difficulty can't change in the middle of a block. It always changes at a known time, and you always know exactly what the difficulty is, so there's no risk here.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">...you are dealing with probability here and not mathematical certainty...</div><br/>That's absolutely true, but over time probability tends towards mathematical certainty. If the server operator is getting a few percent of the generated bitcoins, it doesn't take long to become virtually guaranteed profit.</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I think I initially misunderstood the blocks in that the hashes that we compute are independent of the address. Now, I believe that we are looking for something like sha256 (bitcoint address + amount (I am not sure whether the value is implicit, so this value might not be there)\u00a0 + &lt;answer&gt;) with some desired properties (of which the number of final zeros is an approximation), where + means some concatenation operator of bits.<br/><br/>If the computation is like that, _then_ it might work, but I don't see why someone cannot just only send you the worthless hashes (for you) and don't send those that are useful to you. By this mechanism they can bankrupt you. Anyway, I think it is a bad way to communicate with natural language only about these topics. Just write out the computations that you intend to do on the server and the client and then we can see whether it is a brilliant idea or a flawed one. Annotations on the computations as to which goal they intend to achieve is also useful for communication. <br/><br/>Forcing cooperation out of nodes is not easy. </div>",
