It's not like the currency has any idea how much it is worth in real terms.<br/></div>Ideally, you raise the ceiling in this situation. Right now, there is a 21 million coin limit. So as the value goes up, so does the ceiling so to speak. Unless one person has 20 million bitcoins and the rest of the world has to trade with 1 million, there should be no reason go in the opposite direction for the value to value comparison. But I do understand exactly what you mean though because some world currency is traded like that where 1 unit of XYZ country equals 20,000 of another, so small decimal values have to be used.<br/><br/>Since the transaction fee can't get below 0.01, the value should always be greater than the fee, otherwise, people are not making any financial sense. It would be like living in a city where it cost $10.00 to drink from a water fountain. The business model should fail in light of free, public water fountains outside, so who would bother to pay that much money when the alternative makes more financial sense.<br/><br/>Same way with the 0.01 fee limit, people already expect it and won't value things beneath it as it wouldn't make financial sense.\u00a0 If the lowest possible fee is 0.01, why would anyone sell anything for less than that? You would put yourself out of business quickly.</div>",

If you start with 1 BTC and send 100 x 0.01 transactions to your friend thats 100 transaction chains one step long. He may or may not combine them back together into a single 1BTC transaction but untill he does the net must keep all 100 transactions stored.<br/><br/>If you start with the same 1BTC or 0.01BTC or any single amount and pass it back and forth to your friend 100 times. Its a similar amount of traffic and storage at first but once the last one gets deeply confirmed (ie 6 blocks/1 hr later) you can forget/delete from your disk database all the transactions but the last one. It's the Merkle hash tree pruning stuff in the white paper.<br/></div>",
