It is a paid domain for 2 years and is automatically renewable. Its an extremely inexpensive method for hosting a domain with SSL support and Privacy Protect. ( Less than $5 for 2 years ) I have full control over my A Record etc. and the web host is very stable. In the future I will be adding SSL and the LR and Bitcoin API's to make the exchange service 100% automated, as long as their are available funds.<br/><br/>I'm also advertising in Bitcoin in Money Share Forums / e-currency Investment Forums<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.moneyshareforum.com/index.php?showtopic=3513\">http://www.moneyshareforum.com/index.php?showtopic=3513</a> - Bitcoin P2p Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin P2P Cryptocurrency - Free - Open Source Software Project !<br/><br/>Whilst I would <b>not</b> recommend 'investing' in most of the 'sites' on this forum. Searching through the posts and links will give some of you an incite into just how popular e-currencies are with this type of community. This type of activity makes up a massive percentage of e-currency transactions and I consider it very relevant in the successful future of Bitcoin.<br/><br/>Thank you. <img alt=\"Cool\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/cool.gif\"/></div>",

The price per month is 2000 BTC, which according to the exchange is a discount right now.<br/><br/>Instructions:<br/>Visit <a href=\"http://www.atitd.com\">http://www.atitd.com</a> and download the game client. Native Windows, Linux and OSX versions are available.<br/>Install + Run the client, and create a trial character.<br/>If you like the game, send 2000 BTC to: 17CJvRrNdqSPN3Zs2dWfNY6GoCiMRfNG2T to activate your account.<br/>In the message field, include your character name and shard; I'll then credit you for a month of gameplay.<br/>Right now this is done manually, so the lag could be anywhere from minutes to the next morning.<br/><br/>Teppy</div>",
