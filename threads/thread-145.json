If everyone was limited to just 100 khash/s by the client, someone would just compile a client that does not have the limit and load it up on a server farm where they could generate 10,000 khash/s per machine. It would put the coin generation supply in the hands of who ever had a large amount of money to invest in servers and discourage everyone else from trying to mint coin. If we could trust that clients would only act as transaction nodes and that everyone would get a fair shot at coin generation then no one would care if the client was generating at 5 khash/s all the time.<br/><br/>So in a perfect world, no one would care that they can generate 2 or 3 times faster than someone else, but we don't live in a perfect world.\u00a0 <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/></div>",
