When you transfer coins to an IP, the recipient creates a new address just for that transaction and tells you to transfer coins to that address. A malicious exit node could sniff all Bitcoin traffic and intercept those transactions easily.<br/><br/>So for everyone: DO NOT USE IP ADDRESSES AS DESTINATIONS, ALWAYS USE BITCOIN ADDRESSES.<br/></div><br/>I suggest we disable IP transactions while the user uses a Proxy!<br/>Just to be on the safe side.</div>",
