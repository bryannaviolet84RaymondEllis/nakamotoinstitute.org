If I do a \"netstat -a -n\" on the windows client, I can see it's only connected to the Internal clients and the IRC bootstrap channel and basically doesn't to connect to anyone else on the outside world. You know it's happening because the block count starts to fall behind of what is really going on outside of your local network (Internet for the rest of the world)<br/><br/>It's kind of a self-collapsing loop? Doesn't seem to affect Linux clients though, they will happily connect to and be connected to about as many as it can handle. I could see this is kind of a DoS on windows clients if someone was evil enough.</div>",

But after the 8, it's like it quit connecting out to peers and after a while the incoming peers stopped as well since it appeared to only be concerned with the peers on the LAN vs the WAN. The behavior of the Linux client is different though I've noticed, even if 50 people are connected to it, it will still seek outbound connections to other peers and inbound peers continue to trickle in as well.<br/><br/>While this will only be a problem for people like me that have hundreds of PCs at their disposal, the reverse is, one could setup PC(s) to connect to a single client 8 or more times and then after a while, the poor windows client would suck itself into it's own matrix world where it thinks it's on the network solving blocks, but it's really trapped back in time.<br/><br/>This is just a theoretical attack of course, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it, but I figured I would throw it out there for the future. The easiest way to negate this would be to put in some self-checking code for IPs. Basically, have to check that is has 8 connections or more that are NOT from the LAN/Same IP Address/etc when it's running as a dual node/client mode.</div>",

Second, static linking doesn't mean you can always run it (in my case it tries to load libpng-1.2, which is not present on my system, libpng-1.4 is, and the static fails to load). Third, openssl hasn't been free of security issues, by statically compiling people keep using the insecure version even if their system provides an updated safe version. <br/><br/></div>",
