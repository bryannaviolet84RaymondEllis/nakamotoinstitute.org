I figured most of the people would be honest enough to not do it or there was something behind the scenes preventing it. One idea might be Browser finger print and a 81.x.x.x or 71.x.x.x limit. <a href=\"http://panopticlick.eff.org\">http://panopticlick.eff.org</a> was something the eff did to show just how easy it is to finger print your browser (it checks your os build, Browser build, java, flash, other add-on versions, etc). If you were to combo detect the the browser id's and the first ip block it would be a fairly good way, though it would probably be a fair bit of work. <br/><br/>Another idea would be to add a delay to the coins being sent out, like say an hour after they are cleared the coin goes out. This wouldn't give someone instant satisfaction and would allow you to prevent the coins going out during that hour (Add a check to email yourself if a large number of transactions come through or something like that). Also dropping the coins being given out to 1 or 0.5 would significantly decrease the incentive of doing such a thing.</div>",
