So in the case of a node setting the fee to 1,000 it would likely never include any transactions in blocks it generates, which means it will miss out on any transaction fees other nodes would have gotten. There really isn't a reason to set a nodes requirements higher then the rest of the network since you are basically just pricing yourself out of the market.</div>",
