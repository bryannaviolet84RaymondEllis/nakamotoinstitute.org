        "content": "<div class=\"post\">The difficulty for generating bitcoins is periodically adjusted using a method<br/>that has worked well this far.\u00a0 However, I am afraid there are plausible<br/>scenarios where the current method would misbehave quite spectacularly.<br/><br/>One scenario goes like this:<br/><br/>1) As bitcoins become more known, competition among minters continues to<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 increase, with corresponding increases in difficulty.\u00a0 The increased<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 difficulty will eventually make bitcoin minting clearly unprofitable for<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 those who do not have access to good energy prices and cheap access to an<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 energy-efficient HW/SW combination.<br/><br/>2) Some bitcoin users may continue to mint bitcoins even though it is not<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 profitable for them.\u00a0 This could be due to ideology, the fun factor, or<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 just ignorance.\u00a0 But it is quite plausible that the vast majority of<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 bitcoins will be minted by those who profit from it.\u00a0 Let's say that 99% of<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 all bitcoins are eventually minted by for-profit-minters.<br/><br/>3) The competition among for-profit-minters will drive profit margins down, to<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 the point where it is profitable to continue minting, but barely so.\u00a0 Let's<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 say that the typical profit margin during one difficulty adjustment period<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 (2016 blocks) is 10%.<br/><br/>4) Since bitcoin minting is a decentralized uncoordinated process, we can<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 expect random fluctuations in bitcoin minting activity.\u00a0 This does not<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 affect the difficulty during a specific 2016-block period, so the minting<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 activity can e.g. increase by 20% during a period without making minting<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 unprofitable within that period.<br/><br/>Given the above assumptions, we now have a disaster at hand at the next<br/>difficulty adjustment.\u00a0 As bitcoin production was 20% more than target,<br/>difficulty is adjusted upwards by 20%.\u00a0 But the profit margin was only 10%, so<br/>for-profit-minters would now lose money if they continued minting.\u00a0 They will<br/>therefore stop minting, and as they make up 99% of the minting capacity,<br/>generating the next 2016 blocks will take 100 times longer than normal.<br/>Everything that depends on block generation will slow to a crawl, and this<br/>slowness will persist for a very long time, since the next 2016 blocks will<br/>take 100 times longer to generate (almost 4 years rather than two weeks).<br/><br/>Now, if this was to happen, I guess a new client could be released that resets<br/>the difficulty to some sensible number and started using a better algorithm<br/>for difficulty adjustment.\u00a0 But it would be much better to do it proactively<br/>before it becomes a problem (perhaps with a predetermined \"flag day\"<br/>activating the new algorithm at a certain time in the future, giving the new<br/>client a chance to propagate).<br/><br/>A simple(?) modification of the algorithm would be to apply the adjustment<br/>after a certain amount of time rather than at a certain block number.\u00a0 The<br/>switch could still be synced to take effect for the next block, so time<br/>synchronization between clients would not need to be super exact to have the<br/>vast majority of them agree on when the new difficulty is to be applied.<br/><br/>Also, the difficulty adjustment should probably take into account the<br/>adjustments of the number of bitcoins minted per event (now 50, halved every 4<br/>years).\u00a0 Halving the number of bitcoins generated each time is equivalent to<br/>doubling the difficulty as far as profitability is concerned, and such a<br/>drastical drop in profitability is unnecessary if it can be avoided easily.<br/>I'm not sure if the current adjustment algorithm already takes that into<br/>account somehow, but I couldn't see any obvious adjustment for it in the<br/>source code.<br/></div>",

Even if the average person can sell bitcoins at slightly above production costs, it's difficult to invest more than pocket change worth of electricity per day. Profit on pocket change in exchange for hearing your fan running full blast all day everyday is not very interesting to the average person. If there is a sudden spike in new users, they're not going to all show up at the beginning of a difficulty cycle, stay until the cycle until it's over and then all leave. Most will not last a week generating bitcoins on our already boring to generate network, so as all these flaky new users quit generating, we'll have half a week without them and half a week with them. Those that do stick around will help adjust difficulty back to what it should be.<br/><br/>And like I said about the worst case scenario, if we're going on a week without generating a block, then we start including some transaction fees and somebody from the community rents a cloud to get to the next adjustment.<br/><br/>In short, I don't think there's much anything to worry about.
