        "content": "<div class=\"post\">We had our first automatic adjustment of the proof-of-work difficulty on 30 Dec 2009. \u00a0<br/><br/>The minimum difficulty is 32 zero bits, so even if only one person was running a node, the difficulty doesn't get any easier than that. \u00a0For most of last year, we were hovering below the minimum. \u00a0On 30 Dec we broke above it and the algorithm adjusted to more difficulty. \u00a0It's been getting more difficult at each adjustment since then.<br/><br/>The adjustment on 04 Feb took it up from 1.34 times last year's difficulty to 1.82 times more difficult than last year. \u00a0That means you generate only 55% as many coins for the same amount of work.<br/><br/>The difficulty adjusts proportionally to the total effort across the network. \u00a0If the number of nodes doubles, the difficulty will also double, returning the total generated to the target rate.<br/><br/>For those technically inclined, the proof-of-work difficulty can be seen by searching on \"target:\" in debug.log. \u00a0It's a 256-bit unsigned hex number, which the SHA-256 value has to be less than to successfully generate a block. \u00a0It gets adjusted every 2016 blocks, typically two weeks. \u00a0That's when it prints \"GetNextWorkRequired RETARGET\" in debug.log. <br/><br/>minimum \u00a0 \u00a000000000ffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>30/12/2009 00000000d86a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>11/01/2010 00000000c4280000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>25/01/2010 00000000be710000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>04/02/2010 000000008cc30000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>14/02/2010 0000000065465700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>24/02/2010 0000000043b3e500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>08/03/2010 00000000387f6f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>21/03/2010 0000000038137500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>01/04/2010 000000002a111500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>12/04/2010 0000000020bca700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>21/04/2010 0000000016546f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>04/05/2010 0000000013ec5300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>19/05/2010 00000000159c2400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>29/05/2010 000000000f675c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>11/06/2010 000000000eba6400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>24/06/2010 000000000d314200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>06/07/2010 000000000ae49300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>13/07/2010 0000000005a3f400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>16/07/2010 000000000168fd00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>27/07/2010 00000000010c5a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>05/08/2010 0000000000ba1800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>15/08/2010 0000000000800e00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/>26/08/2010 0000000000692000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br/><br/>date, difficulty factor, % change<br/>2009 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.00<br/>30/12/2009 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.18 \u00a0 +18%<br/>11/01/2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.31 \u00a0 +11%<br/>25/01/2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.34 \u00a0 \u00a0+2%<br/>04/02/2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.82 \u00a0 +36%<br/>14/02/2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 2.53 \u00a0 +39%<br/>24/02/2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 3.78 \u00a0 +49%<br/>08/03/2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.53 \u00a0 +20%<br/>21/03/2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.57 \u00a0 \u00a0+9%<br/>01/04/2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 6.09 \u00a0 +33%<br/>12/04/2010 \u00a0 \u00a0 7.82 \u00a0 +28%<br/>21/04/2010 \u00a0 \u00a011.46 \u00a0 +47%<br/>04/05/2010 \u00a0 \u00a012.85 \u00a0 +12%<br/>19/05/2010 \u00a0 \u00a011.85 \u00a0 \u00a0-8%<br/>29/05/2010 \u00a0 \u00a016.62 \u00a0 +40%<br/>11/06/2010 \u00a0 \u00a017.38 \u00a0 \u00a0+5%<br/>24/06/2010 \u00a0 \u00a019.41 \u00a0 +12%<br/>06/07/2010 \u00a0 \u00a023.50 \u00a0 +21%<br/>13/07/2010 \u00a0 \u00a045.38 \u00a0 +93%<br/>16/07/2010 \u00a0 181.54 \u00a0+300%<br/>27/07/2010 \u00a0 244.21 \u00a0 +35%<br/>05/08/2010 \u00a0 352.17 \u00a0 +44%<br/>15/08/2010 \u00a0 511.77 \u00a0 +45%<br/>26/08/2010\u00a0 \u00a0623.39\u00a0 \u00a0+22%<br/></div>",

It does not matter what exactly gets hashed, and no, you can't cheat without first breaking SHA-256, which is considered difficult.<br/><br/>The salient property of cryptographic hash functions is that they are as random as is possible while still being deterministic. That's what their strength depends on -- after all if they weren't random, if there were obvious patterns, they could be broken that way. So the ideal hash function behaves just like a random number generator. It does not matter what you feed in, timestamp or not, whatever's put in there, the hash should still behave randomly (i.e. every possible outcome has the same a-priori probability of occuring). Incrementing by one works just as well as completely changing everything every step (this follows from the avalanche property). However, the initial value, before you start incrementing, must be (pseudo-)randomly chosen, or every computer will start at the same point, and the fastest one always wins, which is not what is wanted here.</div>",

Functionally, every hash gives you a totally random number between 0 and the maximum value of a 256-bit number. If the random number is equal to or below the target, you win.

I wonder if it writes to the debug log when it has success.<br/></div>Use a value of 1, not 0.5.\u00a0 Suppose max=100 and target=10, then 10 out of every 100 hashes will be at or below the target, so your success rate will be 10% NOT 5%.<br/><br/>At the moment target/max ~= 1.5x10^-11 (target~=0x000000000f, which is 36 zeros, so you basically need to throw a dice with 2^36=69 billion sides, and wait until you get a 1), and you're doing 1 million x 86400 = 86.4 billion hashes per day, so you can expect slightly more than one success per day.<br/><br/>It's VERY important to realise that this is the AVERAGE bitcoin creation time, and will only be valid over periods longer than about a week or so.\u00a0 Because a success event is completely random (I hope, otherwise the hash function is probably not secure and someone will eventually crack it, and therefore bitcoin!), the interval between one success and the next will follow a Poisson distribution with n=0, i.e. an exponential (see wikipedia).\u00a0 Therefore, with an average rate of, say, 1 success per day, you can expect that roughly 10% of the time, you'll have to wait 2\u00bc days or more, 1% of the time 4\u00bd days, 0.1% 7 days and so on.</div>",
