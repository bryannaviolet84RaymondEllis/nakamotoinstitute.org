        "content": "<div class=\"post\">The current BitCoin implementation is certainly better than using a credit card, but I wouldn't use it in environments requiring strong anonymity without a lot of changes.<br/><br/>The history of a coin is publicly available. Anyone can see the flow of BitCoins from address to address.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://img707.imageshack.us/i/unknownaddress.png/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"userimg\" src=\"https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimg707.imageshack.us%2Fimg707%2F317%2Funknownaddress.th.png&amp;t=589&amp;c=eaO-sQGLTbwtGA\"/></a><br/><br/>This becomes a problem when certain points in the \"transaction chain\" become known to the attacker. In the image below, the attacker controls both the source of Mr. Doe's BitCoins and the destination. Since Doe bought his coins using non-anonymous methods, he is easily identified. His identity is tied to an address in the transaction chain.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://img682.imageshack.us/i/known.png/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"userimg\" src=\"https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimg682.imageshack.us%2Fimg682%2F6671%2Fknown.th.png&amp;t=589&amp;c=aWYj6VV_LFnRdQ\"/></a><br/><br/>A more likely scenario is for your BitCoin balance to come from transactions made over insecure channels (email, this forum, etc.). If you're particularly careless, the destination can just Google all of the addresses in the transaction chain. Maybe he'll find that one of them is in your forum signature here.<br/><br/>I've thought of two ways to make this harder. The first is to randomly send your coins to new addresses that you've generated just for this purpose. The coins are still part of your balance, but it's impossible for an outsider to prove that you sent the coins to yourself instead of a real person. However, the transaction chain still has your identity in it. In a real investigation, you would be targeted for close examination because you either know (directly or indirectly) the real person who is under investigation, or you are that person.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://img692.imageshack.us/i/simplemix.png/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"userimg\" src=\"https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimg692.imageshack.us%2Fimg692%2F7418%2Fsimplemix.th.png&amp;t=589&amp;c=jWxI4SumT9BYnw\"/></a><br/><br/>The second way is for an external service to take the coins of many different people, mix them up, and send similar amounts back to those peoples' addresses. If the mixer keeps no logs of who gets which coins, any investigation must stop here.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://img293.imageshack.us/i/external.png/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"userimg\" src=\"https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimg293.imageshack.us%2Fimg293%2F3070%2Fexternal.th.png&amp;t=589&amp;c=uWGtC-5hroQjDA\"/></a><br/><br/>For maximum security, BitCoin should have the capability to automatically send coins through several external mixers. Assuming at least one of them doesn't keep logs (and all of them actually return your coins), this should keep you completely safe.<br/><br/>There's a problem with safely coordinating all of this. You want all of your coins to be mixed at least once, but keeping track of this in a database will ruin your plausible deniability. Probably you'd have to initially keep track, but then delete the database after all the coins have been made safe.<br/><br/>Unrelated to the chain issues above, BitCoin is vulnerable to network analysis. If an attacker can watch all of your incoming and outgoing traffic, he can easily see which transactions are yours. If the connection is unencrypted (as it is now), he can see when you broadcast a transaction that you didn't receive.<br/><br/>Even when encrypted (through Tor or a built-in mechanism), it's not impossible for an attacker to see which transactions are yours if he can see both ends of one of your connections to the BitCoin network.<br/><br/>Your transactions can be identified through Tor like this:<br/>1. The attacker fills the BitCoin network with IP addresses that he controls.<br/>2. When one of these \"evil nodes\" receives a packet, the attacker sees if it was received close to the time when he saw you send a packet. If this happens a few times, the attacker knows who you are and can see your transmissions to the network.<br/>3. When you send a transaction, the attacker knows it's yours if you send it without receiving a packet in a while.<br/><br/>To fix this, BitCoin should implement encryption, padding (to prevent any size-based identification), dummy packets, and randomization in sending times. Some plausible deniability could also be added if BitCoin could export and import transactions to/from a file (importing would broadcast the transaction to the network, while exporting would not). Then you could transmit this file in other ways (a flash drive, for example).<br/><br/>I also see two structural problems not related to anonymity:<br/>- If the network is segmented at the network layer (because the PoTUS executed his \"Internet kill switch\", for example), the block chain will be forked. This would be really bad.<br/>- It's very easy for an attacker with lots of IP addresses to fill the network with cancer nodes. I'm not sure how badly BitCoin could be affected by this.</div>",
