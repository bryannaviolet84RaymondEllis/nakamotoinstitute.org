For some reason the nodes were connecting and disconnecting from Freenode quite rapidly witch resulted in most of my nodes getting k-lined. Freenode started going nuts and blocking my nodes as fast as I was creating connections.<br/><br/>Not too sure if other people were k-line'd as well because of this?? However, the timing was \"bang on\".<br/><br/>I had discovered the bug around the same time this k-line problem was reported. I ended up forcing the source to seed IPs from some Bitcoin clients that I run on a different network.<br/><br/><br/></div>",
