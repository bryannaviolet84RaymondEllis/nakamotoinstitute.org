If we know this we can work backwards and find out why he wants to reject every new block. There must be a transaction in the main chain 1699 or prior that his client disagrees with.<br/></div><br/>He would have to disagree with 1699, but that is an empty block. There's no reason he should disagree with that one.<br/><br/>My theory:<br/><br/>His antivirus cuts off files after a certain size. This caused his block database to be limited at 1698 (and maybe he rejects blocks after that due to corruption). However, his block <i>index</i> was not cut off (because it's shorter), so he ignores incoming blocks as \"already have\", even though he doesn't really have them. Every time he generates a block, it is quickly destroyed by the antivirus, but its confirmations are preserved by the block index for some reason.</div>",
