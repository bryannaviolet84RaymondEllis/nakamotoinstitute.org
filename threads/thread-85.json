On average each BitTorrent user downloads the movie once and uploads it once and that's it. And if you can't or don't want to download that 100G movie pack (like the vast majority of internet users) you can still use BitTorrent for smaller things.<br/><br/>Bitcoin, on the other hand, gives the whole world (assuming the whole world uses it) a live feed of the whole world's financial transactions all the time, and doesn't stop.<br/><br/>Say it becomes a popular payment method like Paypal or Alipay, which each process a few million transactions a day. That few million multiplied by \"less than a kilobyte\" makes at least a few hundred MB per day. That's more than the average person's internet usage. In some places it's more than the average person's available internet quota. And then that has to be distributed to millions of nodes, putting a significant load on some networks, not just individuals' connections.<br/><br/>I guess it's not quite as bad as I initially thought, but it's still enough to make it impractical for many people to run their own bitcoin clients in a world where bitcoin is popular. The likely scenario (assuming no change to how Bitcoin works) is that most people use big payment providers instead and those providers use Bitcoin between each other.<br/><br/>And then one of those providers ends up dominating and has more CPUs than the rest combined, and the whole \"bitcoin is secure as long as the honest CPUs collectively outnumber any attacker\" thing becomes moot.<br/><br/>Maybe.</div>",

It has value only in that people perceive that it has value (the same as any fiat currency). Perceptions change all the time. If you want to see how this plays out look at the currency exchange market today. The value of bitcoin will float over time as supply and demand for it ebbs and flows. The important point is that the supply is fixed (once most of the coins are in circulation) and this serves to protect the value of bitcoin. Inflation erodes the value of currency and punishes savers; its a type of tax.<br/><br/>Perhaps this thread would be more appropriate in the economics forum.</div>",

And nodes will need to keep collecting blocks forever which also doesn't scale.<br/></div>That is a good point, one I didn't think about. \u00a0So, let me think out loud here. There are a possible 21 million coins. Every time a block is generated by someone, they earn 50 coins. Right now, I see 66,618 blocks have been generated since the beginning. So that's 66618 x 50 = 3,330,900 coins so far. To reach 21 million, we need to reach 21,000,000 / 50 = 420,000 blocks. 66,618 blocks take up about 56 megabytes of hard disk space. So, perhaps 420,000 blocks (if every single coin is created) would take up about 420000 x 56 / 66618 = 353 megabytes of hard disk space.<br/><br/>The rest would be transaction history to make sure the owners are valid and older transactions are pruned after a while, so perhaps at full scale, this application could eat up as much as 1GB of hard disk space. So, someone correct me if I'm wrong, but even at full scale, the clients would need about 1GB of hard disk space to contain a fully generated coin network?<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">2) Yes I know it is p2p that is why you have to worry about how the network stays connected and not just assume everyone will be connected.

So that means that the value of bitcoins will have to change over time which isn't ideal. A currency that has 0 inflation/deflation is the most ideal right?<br/></div>Well, imagine if you will, the US and our national gross. It's somewhere in the multi-trillions last I heard. So, if everything had to be converted to dollars, that would be a trillion dollars in circulation (ignore how a complex system like a countries currency, this is way over simplifying). \u00a0No imagine all of that was to be transfered into Bit Coins? Well, there are only 21 million Bit Coins, so a 1 to 1 conversion is out of the question. Basically it would have to be scaled back to the decimal points (probably 4 places) to fit all of that in. That still leaves 4 more decimal places in which any economy working in the Quadrillion range is probably out of scope of any country in the world (or all countries combined really)<br/><br/>So, if you don't think of a 1 to 1 conversion for Bit Coins, because even I want to think of Bit Coins as dollars for example. But it isn't. It is it's own currency within itself whose value is only dependent on the people that use it and what value they give it. It's like that for any currency really, the only difference is, instead of the bank or government in XYZ country being the one who controls how it's created and distributed, WE *all* control how it's created and distributed.<br/><br/>We are *minting* the coin (through CPU cycles to generate the encryption hashes) and at the same time using it for trade and value. The only difference is, this isn't a USA currency or a Swedish currency, it's all completely electronic. The bank, the teller, the minting; is all of us at the same time. Basically, all of our clients have agreed upon certain rules to follow and as long as each client follows those rules, it can participate. Any client that doesn't (through hacking, cheating, etc.) is basically ignored by the rest. It's like playing a game of soccer where you have two teams competing and one guy just up and grabs the ball, runs down to the other side and throws the ball in. Dances up and down that he scored a point. Well, everyone else will just ignore him and his point, he wasn't playing by the set rules. \u00a0<img alt=\"Grin\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/grin.gif\"/></div>",

I am investigating whether this is a project I want to invest time and energy into (I am a professional C++ developer) as I see the potential for a revolutionary technology. However if the solution doesn't scale to millions and millions of transactions per-day (and a very large number of blocks) I fear this solution is destined to become more of an interesting research project rather than something that will have longevity and practical usefulness.</div>",

What would this look like? From a technical perspective what does a \"lightweight client\" look like for you? My understanding is that the Bitcoin client needs the entire block chain in order to establish trust.<br/><br/>I am just thinking out loud here...<br/><br/>Although the peer-to-peer model is certainly novel perhaps it seems to me to be somewhat utopian. Bear with me for a minute here (I am not trying to troll). Consider banks. Banks have a system whereby they can work together efficiently. I take take money out of a ATM from bank X even though I bank with bank Y. Banks loan money to each other. They are generally cooperative. Instead of every Tom, Dick &amp; Harry having a Bitcoin client on his/her PC (or smartphone) participating in an open P2P network, perhaps there is a collection of Bitcoin \"banks\" who provide the service of hosting and \"peering\" the Bitcoin block chain. These are large enough organizations that they can afford the bandwidth and hardware needed to maintain an infinitely long block chain with a million (or more) transactions a day. These banks would still be peer-2-peer, and hopefully also completely open. Ideally anybody could participate in the peer-2-peer network, its just that the average person won't because of the barrier to entry. These banks still operate using the same fundamental technology we have to day. All of the beautiful facets of Bitcoin are preserved, except that the number of active participants is somewhat reduced. Anybody that _wanted_ to participate still could.<br/><br/>The problem remaining would be the typical \"last mile\" problem. How does Tom (or Dick or Harry) perform transactions? Well the issue becomes much more straight forward at this point. Now the trust only has to be between two parties (the \"bank\" and Tom). This really becomes more of a proxy issue. Now Tom has to send a transaction request through his \"bank\". It might even be possible to bake into Bitcoin a protocol for proxy transactions.<br/><br/>Anyway...This is just my 2 cents. I would really like a tangible answer to this problem because it seems foundational to the success of this endeavor to me.</div>",

Perhaps you can illuminate what steps you think need to be taken to \"make it easier for merchants to accept bitcoins and users to pay using them\". In my view, having a lightweight client, build on fairly open standards would facilitate making transactions easier. Ideally this lightweight client would/could be implemented in a number of languages/platforms.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=286.msg2745#msg2745\">Quote from: gavinandresen on July 14, 2010, 04:22:49 AM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">Don't worry much about it until just before it becomes a problem.\u00a0 Don't overengineer, because you're likely to waste time doing something that turns out to be irrelevant.<br/></div><br/>This is certainly good advice: \"beware of premature optimization\". I would like to point out though that optimization and system architecture are different beasts. Planning for scalability is a system architecture task. The whole \"Don't overengineer\" paradigm is more of an implementation &amp; design principle and suggests that we should be agile in that we only implement what we need today. An agile perspective does not preclude thinking about and planning out the system architecture, at least testing assumptions mentally and ensuring that \"it could scale\" when the time comes for that ability to be added. I have been involved in a number of projects that failed not because the underlying technology was bad, but because scalability was never considered or tested up front. Everything worked perfectly until the system was put \"to the (scalability) test\". A lack of planning and foresight up-front was usually the cause.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=286.msg2745#msg2745\">Quote from: gavinandresen on July 14, 2010, 04:22:49 AM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">This quote seems appropriate:<br/>\"We reject: kings, presidents and voting.<br/>We believe in: rough consensus and running code.\"\u00a0 -- David D. Clark<br/></div><br/>I like this quote. There is certainly something to be said for having something that works. I tend to struggle with being a bit of a purist; I have to work at pragmatism. Having said this, you can say: \"we have great software. It has very few bugs and it hardly ever crashes\" and that all sounds well and good until the day it becomes untrue. Scalability issues can hit you quickly and silently, especially in this day-in-age.<br/><br/>My preference would be, for a project like this, would be to continue to have \"working software\" but also establish a well defined road-map of where we hope the software is going. This road map needs to discuss scalability and how we envision a system with a million transactions a day would work and looks, not just today but 20 years from now. A currency needs to be resilient. For people to assign value to Bitcoin they need to perceive that it has value and that it is safe. This means they need to be able to trust that the infrastructure &amp; design is (and will be) perpetually reliable. Unfortunately I don't Bitcoin, if it is to be successful, as the luxury of being just another hacked together open source project (I'm not implying that it is hacky...I'm implying that the prevailing mindset and practice in open source tends to be a \"hack it together\" mind set).</div>",

I don't think having transaction clearing houses necessarily excludes p2p. It depends on how the network was implemented. Assuming things remained open, the transaction clearing houses could still be p2p. Anybody could join in and work to clear transactions. It's just that it wouldn't be required in order to send/receive transactions. It would actually be extremely beneficial if there were literally thousands of transaction clearing houses or if some regular users did participate in the full system to prevent the established clearing houses from conspiring together to cheat the system. That is one of the beauties of bitcoin IMO.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=286.msg2812#msg2812\">Quote from: TopSoil on July 14, 2010, 12:39:51 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">It seems like the best thing would be to lay the system on top of a DHT like kademlia.

Smartphones are a good use case:<br/><ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><li>You don't want to be acting as a peer on a p2p network with a smartphone. It hurts battery life and it could be costly in cellular data charges.</li><li>Smartphones don't have the processing power or storage capacity to either process blocks or store even parts of the block chain.</li></ul><br/>The future is not desktop PCs but is \"thin\" machines like smartphones, tablets and netbooks. These lightweight devices will vastly out-number PCs in the years to come. It isn't tenable to participate in p2p from a thin device, at least in the forseeable future. I think Gavin's ideas of a lightweight bitcoin client seem to address this issue.</div>",
