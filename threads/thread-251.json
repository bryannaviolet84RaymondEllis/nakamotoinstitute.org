Or it isn't possible?<br/><br/>What happened if someone send me money and bitcoin client run on more computers? What happened if I send money to anyone from one of clients? Will it be synchronized automatically?<br/><br/>Maybe it's a simple quetsion but I didn't find answer to this.<br/>Thanks.</div>",
