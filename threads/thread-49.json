I knew bitcoin from before and I though it was a interesting project it seemed too young at the moment. But after speaking with dwdollar over there, I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>Bitcoin is running now in the linux server of my home (and it should be generating coins, I just dont know how long does it take to generate one). Its running on a atom 330 with 1gig RAM and not the processor nor the memory is going out of hand, but I have a problem. I connect to my server using a VNC connection. When I run bitcoin it becomes very sluggish, almost unusable. When I stop bitcoin everything goes ok again. Its running Ubuntu desktop 10.04 amd64 using ia32libs and the binary in bitcoin 0.20 tarball.</div>",

At the end I minimized bitcoin in the tray icon bar and the sluginesh disapeared.

The computer is running my Mythtv server and my torrents 24h so it would have broke alredy if it was in bad state. Also, the Atom 330 does not have a fan. Thre is a fan in the system but it is for the chipset. Curiously enough, Intel did not have time to optimize the chipset as much as the cpu, so the cpu is fanless but the chipset is not, unlike any normal computer system. The next Atom generation is coming or was released shortly and I believe they have integrated the cpu+gpu+memory management (and maybe other stuff) in one chip and the chipset part is small, so it will probably wont require fan. I am not sure if the cpu now requires fan, but if it does not its perfect for a home server. I was previously running a VIA chipset and I dont like Intel too much, but the Atom's are the best at their thing: Low power, low cost and best performance for those characteristics. The atom 330 even runs 720p video without problems (it can not handle 1080p).</div>",
