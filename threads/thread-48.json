Try comparing the time it takes to copy a 50 GB file from one hard drive to another versus copying 50 GB of 1 KB files from one hard drive to another. The 50 GB of 1 KB files will take an eternity to copy. Try to do the same test over the Internet and the 50 GB of 1 KB files will take infinite eternities to finish. I believe Bitcoin already has a few small optimizations for how it downloads blocks but there is still a lot of room for improvement. On the bright side, Bitcoin only has to download old blocks once, after which it stays continuously up to date.</div>",

He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.</div><br/>So you would only download the most recent 200 or so blocks and then new blocks as they come in, relying on the network to verify the blocks for you. It would be a really lightweight way to use BitCoin. It would even be useful for \"full network nodes\" as they are downloading the whole block chain.<br/><br/>Congrats on 100 posts!\u00a0 <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/></div>",

Combining the zip/exe installer with a snapshot of the block chain is not a big deal in my opinion. They can publish hashes and signatures to ensure file integrity, etc.<br/><br/>Even in a worst case scenario where the block chain snapshot was compromised nothing bad will happen. The longest block chain always wins. The client would download a new copy from the P2P network.
