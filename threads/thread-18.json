I have a LAMP system up and running, but until now I used bitcoins on Windows only. Can anyone help me to create a linux installation of Bitcoins with a command line interface?<br/><br/>Server runs Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit. Or should I use a different distribution?<br/><br/>My idea is simple:<br/><br/>- visitor wants to buy something;<br/>- payment page shows him the amount of Bitcoins he has to pay, including an orderid and a ip-address of the server (because messages can only be sent through ipaddress-transactions);<br/>- visitor makes a payment with his Bitcoin application and places the orderid in the message of the payment;<br/>- server receives payment and checks orderid and amount;<br/>- payment is received, visitor is sent a downloadlink/confirmation of purchase/etc.<br/><br/>Think this is possible with Bitcoin 0.2?</div>",
