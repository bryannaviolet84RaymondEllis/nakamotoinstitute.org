A popup saying something like, if I have T coins and I send S coins:<br/>\"S coins where sent to address X.<br/>(T-S) coins where sent to address Y, which belongs to you, in order to improve privacy.

It's not that bitcoin \"empties your wallet\" at each transaction - it fully empties an address used to send coins.
