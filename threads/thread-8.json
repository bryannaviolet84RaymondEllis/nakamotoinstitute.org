        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Hey,<br/><br/>First off I must say that this is an amazing concept. I have been dreaming of a P2P money system for a LONG time.<br/><br/>You have my complete kudos and respect.<br/><br/>I have a few suggestions:<br/><br/>- When the bitcoin software establishes a connection with a peer (client TCP socket) have the client send the handshake string. Right now you have the server (server TCP socket) send the handshake. My reasons for this are anonymity of course. It is far too easy for ISPs to portscan clients and detect they are running this program.<br/><br/>- Use some sort of encryption during the handshake (sort of goes with the statement/request above) to obfuscate what the software is during DPI (deep packet inspection). I am really thinking about people in non-free (as in freedom) countries such as China/Iran.<br/><br/>- Some sort of an API is needed so that this system can be integrated with websites to provide instant-on services. A simple https receipt mechanism would do wonders. Have the client post each incoming payment to an https url with all of the relevant information and provide status updates. Also an outbound payment mechanism would be nice. So one could automate payments (and batch payments) outbound. Status could be returned via the https receipt interface.<br/><br/>- Static port/Random port. Have a setting to randomly assign the port that it runs on. (also be able to set it statically for very restrictive firewalls).<br/><br/>- UPnP support. Have the client automatically create the port forward on upstream routers. Enabled by default. Can be turned off in the options menu.<br/><br/>- Ability to compile a headless (console only) install for *NIX systems. Also have the ability to just run as a network service. Perhaps with a telnet-able port for control (or even a unix socket would be ok).<br/><br/><img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/></div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\"><br/>Most modern P2P software tries UPnP by default. You can (of course) disable it (usually) in the options.<br/><br/>Hmm. I had thought about that as well. Your first idea is probably best. That way you can run the server daemon \"headless\" and have your choice of a front end. (One of the front ends could be a PHP [or C++ CGI] program that runs on your favorite webserver).<br/><br/>This would also enable you to run the front end and back end on different machines. (Ex. headless on a linux server that has a static IP to make receiving payments easier [pay by ip mode] and a front end client for management that can be ran on windows/mac/or something else). Front ends can also be ran on clients with very low cpu power such as mobile phones. *nudge nudge* <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/><br/><br/>One other thing I have thought of is the seeding. The app could be pre-seeded before downloading. You could prepare a new archive daily that is pre-seeded. That would do away with the IRC connection. (Or it could be used as a fallback, I suppose. I still haven't audited the IRC connection code. I am thinking of a few exploits but I don't want to mention them until I am sure they exist.) Pre-seeding would also cure the TOR+IRC problem. I know that people will want to run this system over I2P+TOR. <img alt=\"Tongue\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/tongue.gif\"/><br/><br/>Also you could pre-seed the blocks so they won't have to be downloaded upon initial run. (Downloading 28,000 blocks on a slower ADSL takes forever I couldn't imagine how long it would take when there are millions of blocks -- a lifetime).<br/><br/>Can you give me CVS access or something? (If not, can I send you patches?) I'd like to help out. I am mostly a Linux/BSD guy and I would like to lend my expertise in those areas.<br/><br/>Cheers! <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/><br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=12.msg41#msg41\">Quote from: satoshi on December 09, 2009, 06:45:10 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\"><br/>I'm looking forward to trying UPnP. \u00a0Do most P2P clients typically have UPnP enabled by default?<br/><br/>I'm still thinking about how best to structure the management interface. \u00a0Maybe command line commands to communicate with the background daemon to query transactions received and initiate sending transfers. \u00a0That would be more automation friendly. \u00a0Or what about an http interface on some port other than 80 to manage it with a browser?<br/><br/><br/></div></div>",

I have been dreaming of a P2P money system for a LONG time.<br/><br/>You have my complete kudos and respect.<br/><br/>I have a few suggestions:<br/><br/>- When the bitcoin software establishes a connection with a peer (client TCP socket) have the client send the handshake string. Right now you have the server (server TCP socket) send the handshake. My reasons for this are anonymity of course. It is far too easy for ISPs to portscan clients and detect they are running this program.<br/><br/>- Use some sort of encryption during the handshake (sort of goes with the statement/request above) to obfuscate what the software is during DPI (deep packet inspection). I am really thinking about people in non-free (as in freedom) countries such as China/Iran.<br/><br/>- Some sort of an API is needed so that this system can be integrated with websites to provide instant-on services. A simple https receipt mechanism would do wonders. Have the client post each incoming payment to an https url with all of the relevant information and provide status updates. Also an outbound payment mechanism would be nice. So one could automate payments (and batch payments) outbound. Status could be returned via the https receipt interface.<br/><br/>- Static port/Random port. Have a setting to randomly assign the port that it runs on. (also be able to set it statically for very restrictive firewalls).<br/><br/>- UPnP support. Have the client automatically create the port forward on upstream routers. Enabled by default.

        "content": "<div class=\"post\"><br/>Most modern P2P software tries UPnP by default. You can (of course) disable it (usually) in the options.<br/><br/>Hmm. I had thought about that as well. Your first idea is probably best. That way you can run the server daemon \"headless\" and have your choice of a front end. (One of the front ends could be a PHP [or C++ CGI] program that runs on your favorite webserver).<br/><br/>This would also enable you to run the front end and back end on different machines. (Ex. headless on a linux server that has a static IP to make receiving payments easier [pay by ip mode] and a front end client for management that can be ran on windows/mac/or something else). Front ends can also be ran on clients with very low cpu power such as mobile phones. *nudge nudge* <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/><br/><br/>One other thing I have thought of is the seeding. The app could be pre-seeded before downloading. You could prepare a new archive daily that is pre-seeded. That would do away with the IRC connection. (Or it could be used as a fallback, I suppose. I still haven't audited the IRC connection code. I am thinking of a few exploits but I don't want to mention them until I am sure they exist.) Pre-seeding would also cure the TOR+IRC problem. I know that people will want to run this system over I2P+TOR. <img alt=\"Tongue\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/tongue.gif\"/><br/><br/>Also you could pre-seed the blocks so they won't have to be downloaded upon initial run. (Downloading 28,000 blocks on a slower ADSL takes forever I couldn't imagine how long it would take when there are millions of blocks -- a lifetime).<br/><br/>Can you give me CVS access or something? (If not, can I send you patches?) I'd like to help out. I am mostly a Linux/BSD guy and I would like to lend my expertise in those areas.<br/><br/>Cheers! <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/><br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=12.msg41#msg41\">Quote from: satoshi on December 09, 2009, 06:45:10 PM</a></div><div class=\"quote\"><br/>I'm looking forward to trying UPnP. \u00a0Do most P2P clients typically have UPnP enabled by default?<br/><br/>I'm still thinking about how best to structure the management interface. \u00a0Maybe command line commands to communicate with the background daemon to query transactions received and initiate sending transfers. \u00a0That would be more automation friendly. \u00a0Or what about an http interface on some port other than 80 to manage it with a browser?<br/><br/><br/></div></div>",

Pre-seeding would also cure the TOR+IRC problem. I know that people will want to run this system over I2P+TOR.<br/></div>Yeah, we can phase out IRC when there are enough static nodes to preprogram a seed list.\u00a0 Once you get seeded, you don't need IRC.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">Also you could pre-seed the blocks so they won't have to be downloaded upon initial run. (Downloading 28,000 blocks on a slower ADSL takes forever I couldn't imagine how long it would take when there are millions of blocks -- a lifetime).<br/></div>There were some issues in 0.1.5 where the initial block download could get bogged down.\u00a0 0.2 has code to make sure it goes smoothly.\u00a0 It ought to take less than an hour, I think.\u00a0 I need to hurry up and get 0.2 out the door.<br/><br/>The blocks increase linearly, it'll be decades before it's millions.\u00a0 In theory, the block download time should top out 8 months from now when Moore's Law will be growing faster than the block chain.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">Can you give me CVS access or something? (If not, can I send you patches?) I'd like to help out. <br/></div>It's SVN on sourceforge.\u00a0 PM or e-mail me your sourceforge account and I'll give you access.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">I am mostly a Linux/BSD guy and I would like to lend my expertise in those areas.<br/></div>That's great because that's where I have less expertise.\u00a0 For instance, I haven't researched the best way to do the \"Start Bitcoin on system startup\" feature on Linux.\u00a0 On Windows, the option adds/removes an icon in the Startup folder.<br/></div>",

Will this give me access to the current branch you fellows are currently working on? (0.2)<br/><br/>I have been trying to think of the options that will be needed for the backend process. I wonder which would be better: a long set of command line switches or a configuration file. Hmm...<br/><br/>I have a lot of servers spread across the globe. If we can get to the point where we have a working backend process that will run on FreeBSD I can run always-on seeds.<br/><br/>I really think that having the download package contain a daily seed snapshot will improve the bootstrapping. I have seen instances on new test installs here where the application will sit with 0 connections / 1 block. Upon inspecting the debug.log I find that the IRC server (freenode, I believe) claims I am already connected and refuses to let me seed the application. (Just an example).<br/><br/>I think that a simple network monitor plugin for Nagios would be helpful as well. Something that can emulate a connecting client, and retrieve a valid status code from the backend process. I have a lot of ideas. <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/><br/><br/>In any event, I would like to help.

The windowing is native carbon too via wxwidgets! It is FAST! <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/> I had to create a new makefile (makefile.osx; based on makefile.unix of course.. given any thought to using autoconf?) and put some ifdef's into header.h. I have patches. I will keep toying around. I might try it on FreeBSD next.<br/><br/>I already run a great deal of TOR and I2P nodes so for me to add this app to those same servers is a snap. <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/><br/><br/>I think that breaking bitcoin into two apps is ideal. A wxwidgets front end (since it is mostly all there) and a backend that binds to a control TCP socket. I have been reading over the source to see how hard it would be to break it apart and I think it should be fairly simple. Of course an API would have to be developed.<br/><br/>I'll keep toying around with the source code and see what I can come up with.<br/><br/><img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/><br/></div>",
