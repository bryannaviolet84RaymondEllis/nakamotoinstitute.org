I still may do it just to see if I can get any because it's just another way to make a few more bitcoins per day.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say that it is the equivalent of leaving a pile of cash in your driveway with a rock on top of it to keep it from blowing away in the wind.\u00a0 Anyone can just go pick it up and so if you're a service provider you would not want to encourage your customers to pay you in that way, because it would just cause problems when the customer says they paid and the service provider says they didn't receive it.\u00a0 The only reason it's even possible to use on the internet right now is because unlike cash which has perceived value to a lot of people, bitcoins are like a pile of rocks to random internet users, they just walk by.\u00a0 If there are all these piles of bitcoins in everybody's driveway and people start figuring out that they're valuable, you can bet they'll start disappearing, so it's best not to put them there in the first place.<br/><br/>Laszlo<br/></div>",

Except maybe for cable access where your neighbor can sniff you.<br/><br/>This bitcoin.org:19vcWM6EEbQHVdN2W8NXv9ySgsPjbZ6gU3@12.34.56.78 is about as practical as nothing. What would be the simplification-add of such? Try to say to someone over the phone your BC address on such manner.<br/><br/>Let's do one thing, right: PUT TOR ASIDE. One thing is using BC for anonymous payments / OTHER is to make non-anonymous payments.<br/>If you're up to do anonymous payments, that's already sorted: Use BC address and that's it.<br/><br/>It's then a matter of choices, if for security reasons you feel more confortable with it disabled, do it like: Disabled by default / Enable if you want and know what you're doing.<br/><br/><b>Someone could hijack my site and show another BC address</b><br/>-Someone could hijack your site and show another PayPal email also. Defacings aren't however easy to do, you don't see sites defaced everyday.<br/><br/><b>Someone could hijack DNS to resolve to something else</b><br/>-Someone could hijack your bank's login and make you pass over your password to it... again DNS hijack/spoof isn't also that easy to do. Theoretically (again) it is, but that would be if you were using some bogus Nameserver. If you use your ISP defaults it would be rather complicated. And if someone invaded your PC to make it change DNS's, then that same one would open your BC Client and send all your BC's to his address.<br/><br/>So, in the end, my proposal is:<br/><br/>Split the \"project idea\" in two different (way different) branches:<br/><br/>1 - Anonymous payments - Using BC Address exclusivelly<br/>2 - Non-anonymous (regular) payments - Using BC Addresses OR DCC.<br/><br/>It makes no sense at all to use Tor arguments over branch 2.</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">SirArthur has a good point about the normal online merchant case, which is what the send-by-IP option is more suited to.\u00a0 This is the case where the merchant will have a server on a static IP and their own domain name and SSL cert.<br/><br/>Instead of connecting by IP, we can connect to a domain name by SSL, using the existing CA infrastructure to authenticate that you're connected to the owner of that domain.<br/><br/>The user would send to domain.com (or <a href=\"http://www.domain.com\">www.domain.com</a> is ok too).\u00a0 That would be very natural and users could see and verify that what they entered is who they intend to pay.<br/><br/>The SSL also makes it safe for TOR users.<br/><br/>Problem is, I think merchants would still prefer to use bitcoin addresses to be certain they know what the payment is for.\u00a0 You simply cannot count on users to enter the right thing in the comment fields to identify the transaction.\u00a0 It would only approach practical if we had a mailto style link that prepopulates the comment field with the order number, but then the link could just as well be a bitcoin address. <br/><br/>Just having an open bitcoin server at domain.com that users could send unidentified payments to would be too much of a liability.\u00a0 Regular users aren't used to the idea of having to identify the payment.\u00a0 Merchants would get too many blank payments followed by \"I paid you, where's my stuff?!\" a week later.<br/><br/>The payment sequence does have a step where the receiver verifies the order before accepting it.\u00a0 It can reject the payment and return an error message if it doesn't contain a valid order number.\u00a0 That would require a difficult level of integration of custom code with the bitcoin server though.</div>",
