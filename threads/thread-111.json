        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I run my computers off solar-generated electricity, so I keep pretty tight tabs on how much power they consume.<br/><br/>I have one headless Ubuntu server that is always-on, usually with the disk array spun down, as it has some central network management roles.\u00a0 It's an Intel Core2Duo E6300 @ 1.86 GHz, and mines at about 950 khash/s.<br/><br/>I was curious to see the impact bitcoind generation would have on it.\u00a0 Here is what it looks like:<br/><br/><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"userimg\" src=\"https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trix.com%2FGroundLoop%2Fbitcoin.png&amp;t=589&amp;c=OZl2FBYhFPMIcg\"/><br/><br/>The lowest level on the left is idle, and the noise after it is bitcoind inhaling the block history.\u00a0 The step up is the bitminer threads.<br/>In short, hashing raised the idle floor from about 120W to 160W, or +40W.<br/><br/>This draws 29 kilowatt-hours a month from my generation, which means I net some $3.80 less for power ($0.13/kwh marginal power rate)<br/><br/>If I generate an average of 13 blocks a month at the current difficulty, BTC 650, that puts my cost at about US$0.005/BTC.<br/><br/>In short, I'm better off buying BTC from the exchange than generating them on this particular machine.\u00a0 Food for thought.</div>",
