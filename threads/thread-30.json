        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Hi, intrigued by the bitcoin-system, I have an idea:<br/><br/>The bitcoin addresses could be improved by implementing an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme\">URI-scheme</a> like e.g. torrent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme\">magnet links</a>.<br/><br/>So instead of <i>1Nu6wZC7JSuh6h8nfKkSTZ4kp9U4f83hhZ</i>, we could more unambiguous say <i><a href=\"bitcoin:?addr=1Nu6wZC7JSuh6h8nfKkSTZ4kp9U4f83hhZ\">bitcoin:?addr=1Nu6wZC7JSuh6h8nfKkSTZ4kp9U4f83hhZ</a></i>, and even configure browsers to redirect clicks on such links to a bitcoin client. This would allow one to implement \"donate buttons\" on homepages, \"pay buttons\" on webshops etc.<br/><br/>If an IP should be included, URIs allow this as <i><a href=\"bitcoin://HOST_OR_IP:PORT?addr=1Nu6wZC7JSuh6h8nfKkSTZ4kp9U4f83hhZ\">bitcoin://HOST_OR_IP:PORT?addr=1Nu6wZC7JSuh6h8nfKkSTZ4kp9U4f83hhZ</a></i>. If wanted an amount could be specified as <i><a href=\"bitcoin:?amount=42.00;addr=1Nu6wZC7JSuh6h8nfKkSTZ4kp9U4f83hhZ\">bitcoin:?amount=42.00;addr=1Nu6wZC7JSuh6h8nfKkSTZ4kp9U4f83hhZ</a></i> (of course for the user to verify in the secure bitcoin-client).<br/><br/>Just my 0.02 \u0e3f (return them to <a href=\"bitcoin:?addr=1Nu6wZC7JSuh6h8nfKkSTZ4kp9U4f83hhZ\">bitcoin:?addr=1Nu6wZC7JSuh6h8nfKkSTZ4kp9U4f83hhZ</a> if you don't like them <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/>)</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I'm wondering if anybody is doing anything about this idea, as I have been researching the possibility of implementing some Internet browser functionality, as per <a href=\"http://'http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=123.0'\">this thread</a> and the wonderful developments <a href=\"http://'http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=63.0'\">described here.</a> It seems that it may be easier first steps, (I'm learning as I go) to try this out and include it with whatever other features the Firefox add-on evolves. <br/><br/>Before this can happen there needs to be a consensus about what form the URI would take. I have done some quick research on the URI schemes and most approaches are frowned upon without W3C approval, there is one category whereby the W3C approves a tentative URI scheme and holds it in reserve, with no guarantees (like a provisional patent), but by far the most suitable scheme, seems to be the magnet URI, which was designed to find a resource by the hash being a product of its content uniqueness, rather than by specific address. Magnet was intended for use by applications on peer to peer networks and has reserved parameters for reference to application specific data. Basically, you simply preface the application specific parameter with an x as in xbitcoin1:?<br/><br/>Maybe it is good, not to try implementing a new top level URI scheme, as it is regarded as an ad lib maneuverer, if it is not recognized universally. Adopting the magnet system would avoid this, but in itself magnet is an informal, unregistered scheme. The beauty of magnet is that it can be shared and is open in that sense. <br/><br/>Now, that might all seem very good, because bitcoin is after all a P2P application and it's network does operate on similar principals, but what if the person clicking on the link is not a bitcoin user? What if you want to incorporate some information that is not carried in the existing network, such as the article being sold, shipping information and various other issues. My understanding is that bitcoin only handles the transaction itself, so the user is left to make all other arrangements, contracts and communications independent of bitcoin. Here's where the anonymity is compromised, because here, we are inclined to resort to conventional 'hierarchical\u00a0 hardwired, or non-anonymous technologies. That's not a criticism of bitcoin by any stretch, because bitcoin is a fantastic way to transact, no question about it. But the transaction is only one side of the coin, if you'll pardon that cheesy pun. <img alt=\"Grin\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/grin.gif\"/> <br/><br/>In the process of investigating URI's I was reminded of freenet and the magnet like system they use, and I ended up back there checking it out. Given that freenet is a user/identity-space intended for information storage, couldn't it also be used as a repository of human readable data files, particular and unique to each user, and incorporating any format of data you wish to use, for embellishing your transaction? Couldn't this be used for hooking the URI into a rich database of application specific data, that has been designed for the publishers own website functionality or business system? While your bitcoin node takes care of the actual transaction, the freenet node takes care of the individual data presented. <br/><br/>This should keep everything under the same kind of cryptographic P2P infrastructure, and allow infinite diversity of application specific context. I suppose a unique URI hash key, could be borne out of the combination of your freenet+bitcoin hashes and the file encrypted with your freenet key found by decrypting with your bitcoin key, while your bitcoin node can be addressed the other way around. Does that sound right? Of course, if you use your real identity on one, then I guess then, you real identity would be divulged on the other. <br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm sure there's some way to do it. Again, freenet also uses an unregistered URI scheme, but if a variant of magnet is adopted, that will not be a problem. The question remains, if people have hopes of bitcoin becoming a formal recognized currency and a very legitimate deal, then the strict adherence to all other internet protocols might be advisable. I have noted so far nothing in particular that would prevent the registration of a magnet/freenet like URI scheme. I haven't searched them all but one may even exist. Otherwise why not register one?<br/><br/>So the URI scheme needs to be agreed upon as to the classification (i.e. what kind magnet etc, as well do we go legit/formal or not) and format, such as how it is to be laid out: <br/><br/><div align=\"center\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 10pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;\">Components Of A URI</span></b><br/><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"userimg\" src=\"https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2F%40api%2Fdeki%2Ffiles%2F3267%2F%3Duri-diagram.png&amp;t=589&amp;c=IB2e7gz117wstg\"/><br/>This speaks to the conventions that Mozilla will account for in parsing a URI.<br/></div><br/>A typical magnet URI, looks like this<br/><br/>magnet:?xt=urn:sha1:YNCKHTQCWBTRNJIV4WNAE52SJUQCZO5C<br/><br/>A freenet URI is like this:<br/><br/><a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8888/USK@oshw3DxmJUt7q4ThF4dCez5IXbc9hCGcv0VuwLRCmeQ,ckeXv20F1gBzkqssB4RXHZ2nB1YRT8Pb8KYZk8wj-bs,AQACAAE/occamsrazor/6/f.pdf\">http://127.0.0.1:8888/USK@oshw3DxmJUt7q4ThF4dCez5IXbc9hCGcv0VuwLRCmeQ,ckeXv20F1gBzkqssB4RXHZ2nB1YRT8Pb8KYZk8wj-bs,AQACAAE/occamsrazor/6/f.pdf</a><br/><br/>To be recognized at all, the freenet program needs to be installed and this includes a Java powered web server that recognizes the resource as an item in identity space of the localhost. i.e. my browser sees the whole of freenet as being on my machine. I don't know if this identity space could be addressable without the user having to run a web-server, but I suspect the server is only for the ability to serve web pages as well as recognition of the localhost as the requisite top level domain. The 'http:' indicates that the freenet URI, is nothing special in itself, but the IP address (localhost) certainly is. I suspect a program can address the freenet user space, without incorporating a web server, and the universal links can be made as magnet URIs. As for those who don't have bitcoin installed, I don't know how the URI could be made to have a default fall back, to redirect visitors of that link. to the Sourceforge download for bitcoin. That may need to implemented in code and cookie or environ variable set to record the presence of bitcoin. <br/><br/>Other relevant sites I have visited in the course of this research include:<br/><br/><ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><li><a href=\"http://infomesh.net/2001/09/urischemes\">http://infomesh.net/2001/09/urischemes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.search.com/reference/Magnet:_URI_scheme\">http://www.search.com/reference/Magnet:_URI_scheme</a></li><li><a href=\"http://magnet-uri.sourceforge.net/\">http://magnet-uri.sourceforge.net/</a></li><li><a href=\"http://magnet-uri.sourceforge.net/magnet-draft-overview.txt\">http://magnet-uri.sourceforge.net/magnet-draft-overview.txt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes\">http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes#Registration\">http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes#Registration</a></li></ul><br/>Any ideas/comments/feedback is/are welcome.\u00a0 <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/><br/>Steve<br/><br/></div>",

Simply addressing a preconfigured freenet server should do the trick, but perhaps even the existing code can be slightly modified to directly address freenet (without the implicit web server included in the proper freenet install), but by including this FCP code, in the browser add-on, just the addressing and communicating functionality may be incorporated without the overhead of a full blown freenet http server. I assume at this point, the freenet web server, is only needed by the client for browsing freenet, not to service a node. As Bitcoin already addresses a similar P2P network, how hard would it be to make the bitcoin server do freenet inquiries? Could such trickery be included in the JSON intreface?<br/>\u00a0<br/>From: <a href=\"http://new-wiki.freenetproject.org/FCPv2\">http://new-wiki.freenetproject.org/FCPv2</a><br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">Purpose<br/><br/>The Freenet Client Protocol is a simple, text-based protocol designed to allow third-party applications to interact with Freenet.

The first issue is that files on a hard drive are mapped to a hierarchical namespace of nested locations, i.e. domains and directories. The fundamental difference, in approach of the many P2P networks is that the namespace is not hierarchal and the data it supports is referenced not by address but by the uniqueness of it's content. Whether the target is a file or anything else it's not referenced by a specific fixed address, but by the identity of it's unique contents.

Going from a lightweight URL-handler that brings up the Bitcoin client to requiring Freenet is a bit of a leap. This really should be optional.</div><br/>Well actually it's a URN handler and I didn't specify any limit to the 'weight' as you put it. I would be more concerned with robustness and not being painted into a corner myself. The effort to implement backward compatibility and forward extensibility, having been considered from the outset, is a small price IMHO. In any case I am only contemplating this, in the hope it can be done without installing freenet, at least the chunk of code needed to read and write to and from freenet should be much smaller if (as I suspect) the whole freenet web server is not needed. Also the URI should of course include this freenet functionality, as an optional parameter. So if not specified, the information to do the basic transaction would still be legitimate. It would not then be compulsory to use in publishing the URI, but the handler should still be able to take the parameter if it is used, otherwise the optional choice you are proposing is between two different incompatible URI schemes. Measure twice, cut once.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">However, it really would be very nice to add additional information to a transaction. Building on ec's initial post, and the need for further details, I think we should have the following url parameters (or shorter versions of them):<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* address: An address to send bitcoins to. Since one can hand out different addresses to different people, this can also define the sender.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* amount (optional): The amount to send.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* message (optional): A short message that describes the transaction (same as the field in the Bitcoin client)<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* details (optional): An encoded URL with further details of the transaction. For a purchase in an online shop, this could link to the details of the purchase for example. Since this would be a full-featured URL in itself, you could also link to freenet, i2p and tor to keep things anonymous.<br/></div><br/>Not sure what you mean by address, other than the 'address' that is provided by your bitcoin signature (which is more like a name than a place). I cant see how you can hand out different addresses to different people, unless you already have some aliases defined. So you are suggesting an added naming system to encode and translate aliases for a bitcoin node, is that what you mean? That could be done without too much hassle I suppose.<br/><br/>The amount: Yup goes without saying.<br/><br/>Message: This is where URI data becomes unwieldy. A message is implicitly a useful amount of human communication, which was never intended to be delivered in the URI itself. The need to reference a supplementary document begins here. The payer can send their message in the software interface (either the standalone program or the Firefox add-on), The link, at a minimum, identifies the recipient and the amount, that must be passed to the software. If the receiving party wants to communicate some text, then they can do so in the document they are publishing (IE. where they are publishing the link). The text for the sending party, can use the normal route, as the link invokes the bitcoin interface and that provides the field to include a note. What message needs to be passed by the receiver (payee) that is not possible in the document in which they are publishing the link? What message needs to be passed by the payer, that is not possible in the interface, but is possible by clicking on the link? That would imply that the link invokes methods like post or get, that are exclusively http/s functionality, that is defeating the purpose of having a purpose made URI scheme. Post and Get functions need to be addressed within the hierarchical namespace of TCP/IP and/or physical file path names. <br/><br/>Details: I advocated from the outset, the desirability of the URI scheme, being able to reference a document with a richer data structure, that can be used to embellish upon the basic essential information passed by the obligatory parameters. I also suggested a proposed repository for those documents which lead to some accessibility issues, but if solved would enhance the anonymity of the bitcoin node and circumvent the reliance on non-P2P or hierarchical namespace. The possibility of taking a beautiful network addressing protocol and remapping it with (or kludging it onto) a regressive, inferior, butt ugly one, which requires all entities to adopt the analogy of a fixed location, and loose all hard wired associations if they are shifted, seems to me as tactful as giving a beautiful stone building a coat of cheap plastic paint; bright green paint. A URL for a parameter, Is precisely the kind of butchery I would rather avoid, because a URL is not a URN and the namespace it addresses, is hierarchical and must ultimately reside at a fixed IP. <br/><br/>As far as this <b><i>\"you could also link to freenet, i2p and tor to keep things anonymous.\"</i></b> is concerned, you clearly haven't given it much thought. If I could just link to freenet, then I could just as easily incorporate freenet as the actual repository referenced in the URI to begin with. That's the problem. You can't just store files on freenet, and expect anybody to be able to retrieve them with a URL or a URN, on a regular website, unless the visitor has the client software to handle the link, the reference it gives will be useless. If I can make the URI handler address the freenet namespace, then I suggest it would much better to store the files there in the first place. Because http/s operates on a hierarchical namespace and P2P clients operate on non-hierarchical namespace, the one parameter can't be used to interdependently address both. It's a bit late for you to decide to become anonymous after you have fixed your identity to a physical locus.<br/><br/>If I have misunderstood you I apologize DataWraith, but you don't seem to appreciate the difference between the two namespace models, nor their relative advantages and liabilities. I am sill quite willing to consider any other system of schema. I am not rejecting your criticism out of hand, nor insisting my own preferences should be the default. I would prefer to simply make the best URI scheme possible regardless.

I was thinking in terms of links only as instigators of payment events, but of course, if the amount and other parameters are left blank, it should then default to acting as an identifier link to instigate a payment at the behest of the payer. A simple donate button would only need one parameter and zero redirections/login/confirmation/calculate and change currency before you can finally send, to not see your transaction eating the dust of snailmail on horseback, in the event that you don't have a credit card. (Suck on that that PlayPal). That, along with the naming alias idea suggested by DataWraith AKA (having an address), if that;s what you meant DataWraith, is certainly worth implementing for my bitcoin.\u00a0 <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/><br/></div>",

The user runs freenet and Bitcoin would communicate with it using its control protocol. However, running Freenet requires considerable computer resources, especially bandwidth, and personally, I do not want to run a freenet node for that reason alone. That's why I wanted this to be optional.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">I hope I didn't give the impression that I either intend to use magnet links without more consideration of/ agreement with others, nor that my provisional support for them is based on their existing popularity.</div><br/>I had the impression that you did not want to re-invent the wheel, and that's why popularity played a part -- that the existing acceptance of magnet links in other software was a plus. <br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\"><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">Magnet links were designed to reference a file or set of files on peer-to-peer networks, and as such all well-known parameters refer to files (file name, size, etc.).</div><br/>Sorry DataWraith, but with all due respect, I have to disagree. The first issue is that files on a hard drive are mapped to a hierarchical namespace of nested locations, i.e. domains and directories. The fundamental difference, in approach of the many P2P networks is that the namespace is not hierarchal and the data it supports is referenced not by address but by the uniqueness of it's content. Whether the target is a file or anything else it's not referenced by a specific fixed address, but by the identity of it's unique contents. Identical files, are essentially the same identity and the P2P application can use multiple instances as multiple feeds to the same item. The parameters of magnet are well suited to any P2P application. </div><br/>Okay, sorry, seems I haven't made entirely clear what I mean here. I'm aware of how magnet links refer to content, rather than a location in a hierachical namespace.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's just a difference of mental models: For me, a bitcoin transaction is, for lack of better words, not a <b>thing</b> so much as a <b>process</b>. In my mind, magnet links refer to things (usually a file -- whether by content hash or by location), and trying to use them to refer to a process strikes me as a little awkward. Magnet links identify things you then have to go fetch, while a bitcoin transaction is completely described by the link itself (although you still have to say \"Yes, send the coins.\" once you click the link).<br/><br/>To me it seems that using magnet links would be to (ab)use them for something they were not meant to describe, as they orignated as a replacement for ed2k://, freenet://, et al., describing how to get a file.<br/><br/>A bitcoin-link should be more like mailto: than magnet: IMHO.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">Well actually it's a URN handler and I didn't specify any limit to the 'weight' as you put it.</div><br/>Yeah, my mistake, sorry.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">In any case I am only contemplating this, in the hope it can be done without installing freenet, at least the chunk of code needed to read and write to and from freenet should be much smaller if (as I suspect) the whole freenet web server is not needed.</div><br/>IIRC the web server is pretty much integrated into Freenet itself. You can use the simpler FCP protocol to talk to a Freenet instance, but because of the type of content on Freenet, not many people are willing to host a publicly accessible instance, so you would have to run your own. I don't begrudge that you want to be able to do this, I'm just not willing to do it myself. I'd much rather host a TOR hidden service -- that's why I suggested to use a general, full-featured URL as the details parameter, instead of making it freenet specific.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\"><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">\u00a0 \u00a0 * address: An address to send bitcoins to.

I called it address, because that's what it says in the bitcoin client (i.e. \"Change your address\"). I indeed thought that one should use different aliases, just like the exchange sites currently do: You get an address (or signature, or whatever) to send coins to, and because that address was only given to you, the recipient knows the payment is from you.<br/><br/>A system to translate aliases would of course be nice, but I think that's better handled with an address book or <a href=\"http://mybitcoin.com\">mybitcoin.com</a> or something.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\">Quote</div><div class=\"quote\">Message: This is where URI data becomes unwieldy.

Barring that, it should be possible to embed an observable but unalterable message with address transactions.

If you confirm the payment then it sends the coins to the domain and then redirects to the return value in the query string. bitcoin could add a ?paid=true or ?paid=false to the return location as well so the return script on the domain could then check if it received the payment correctly, or cancel the order.<br/><br/>Edit: the bitcoin interface should also have a password before you can confirm the payment.

At the moment, Bitcoin only binds RPC to the loopback interface, 127.0.0.1. I would assume that this web interface would be the same. However, there SHOULD be a password to prevent trojans from trivially sending your wallet away. Wallet encryption needs to happen, too.</div>",
