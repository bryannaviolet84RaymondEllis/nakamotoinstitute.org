        "content": "<div class=\"post\">If I was a C++ programmer, I would make multiple instances of Bitcoin automatically talk to each other. But then again, I don't know how hard it is to do cross platform interprocess communication. If a data directory was already being used by one instance, then the new instance would be required to use a different data directory. Sure, you probably can make multiple instances share some or all the files in a data directory, but I think it's a bad idea since it the likelihood for little bugs is high, but the likelihood of the likelihood of those being discovered, researched, reported and fixed is low since the feature wouldn't get much exposure. Imagine the mess it will make if somebody starts half a dozen instances. <img alt=\"Shocked\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/shocked.gif\"/></div>",
