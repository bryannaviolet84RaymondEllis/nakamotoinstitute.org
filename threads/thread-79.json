Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network based digital currency with no central bank, and no transaction fees. Using a proof-of-work concept, nodes burn CPU cycles searching for bundles of coins, broadcasting their findings to the network. Analysis of energy usage indicates that the market value of Bitcoins is already above the value of the energy needed to generate them, indicating healthy demand. The community is hopeful the currency will remain outside the reach of any government.<br/><br/>Comments?<br/><br/>[Edited the \"energy backed\" language.]<br/>[Eliminated the 21M number, as db suggested. Mentioning subdividing would be too wordy.]<br/>[Incorporated some of amall's suggestions, including eliminating the passive voice in the final sentence.]<br/>[Integrated satoshi's suggestions, eliminating the word \"anonymous\", mention of Hashcash, and the \"developers expect\" taunt.]<br/>[Changed the closing sentence to dwdollar's \"...community is hopeful...\" language.

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I wouldn't call bitcoin \"energy backed\". \u00a0There has been ample discussion on this and varying opinions, but I think most people would say that the bitcoin's value determines the amount of energy required to generate them, and not the other way around.<br/><br/>In the short run, the energy cost of generation may ensure a baseline value, but in the long run the value will be solely based on human behavior.<br/><br/>Thanks for pushing for a slashdot feature, bitcoin could <i>really</i> use some publicity to help it grow.</div>",

Bitcoin is a buyer-anonymous, seller-anonymous cryptocurrency with no central bank, and no transaction fees. Using a concept similar to Hashcash, clients burn CPU cycles attempting to discover some of the 21,000,000 Bitcoins that will eventually be found. It is expected that over time, the market value of Bitcoins will reach parity with the energy needed to generate them, resulting in an energy-backed currency outside the reach of any government.<br/><br/>Comments?<br/></div><br/>1) I like the first two sentences.<br/><br/>2) Not sure whether I would include the \"similar to Hashcash\" phrase. I doubt that the majority of slashdot users has ever heard of Hashcash.<br/><br/>3) I have a problem with the \"energy-backed\" claim. It's misleading. Just because you need to invest energy to generate Bitcoins doesn't make them energy-backed. They would only be energy-backed if there was some sort of guarantee that they could be traded back into energy. Which there isn't. The generation of Bitcoins is irreversible. If the software was hardcoded so that you could buy other users' CPU cycles with Bitcoins, then maybe we could call them energy-backed. <br/><br/></div>",
