I modified the ByteSwap function to operate on 64-bit integers; it does this by using the bswap intrinsic on a 64 bit register followed by rotate right through 32 bits to put the result in the correct order. it also initializes the SHA256 vectors using unsigned 64 bit values (however, the actual hashing still uses 32-bit so I doubt this is making much of a difference) and yes, I did convert the 32 bit numbers to 64 bit correctly (i.e. 0x12345678UL 0xabcdef0UL -&gt; 0xabcdef012345678ULL) if that appears wrong to you, think about how little endian machines store 32 bit integers in memory.<br/><br/>anyway, <span style=\"font-size: 20pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;\"><a href=\"http://www.4shared.com/file/iHQA_p96/Bitcoin_Intel_x64_tweaked.html\">grab it here</a></span><br/></div>I'll give this one a run, the last build would crash randomly after a few hours\u00a0 <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/></div>",

Based on how many khash/s they are getting they do not have 7 cores or a running in a vm. If they do have 7 cores they should post a cpuz screenshot because, it would seem that we have an outlier in the performance boosts and it would be good to figure out why.<br/><br/>Back on topic, My desktop have been crunching away since last night @ \u00a006:57 am forum time (9 hours) using the intel build, no crashes, blocks are coming in, and I have 29 connections. </div>",

How can you possibly have 7 cores? What Processor are you running, Cores come in even numbers . . . I would check your processor is working correctly. How do you even know that you have 7 cores and you don't know how to control them. I'm guessing your a Windows user. <br/><br/>I had to register to rebel against some of the crap I see been posted here! <br/></div><br/>Every time he posts I want to poke him in the eye, the one conveniently posted to the left of his friendly well-meaning nonsense \u00a0<img alt=\"Grin\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/grin.gif\"/><br/></div><br/>Ive only had one post . . . so far!

Windows will work with 3 cores or 4 cores just fine, it doesn't care how many it has.<br/></div><br/>VMware only permits even numbers of processors/cores although I believe you can expose 8 cores and then configure the OS to only see 7.<br/><br/>if he really does have this setup, I'm going to bet that he's opted for more processors/cores than his CPU actually has (yep, you can do this but it will have a pretty negative effect on performance)<br/></div>I was thinking about Virtual Box when I wrote that\u00a0 <img alt=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/wink.gif\"/></div>",

Additionally, the Intel compiler really comes into its own here as its parallelisation abilities give a massive performance boost over Visual Studio.<br/><br/>Performance: 4700khash/s on 4 cores, I think that speaks for itself.<br/><br/>I've included both the VS and Intel build, but there's really no comparison, the Intel build craps all over VS.<br/></div>Is that still starting from Crypto++?\u00a0 Lets get this into the main sourcecode.</div>",
