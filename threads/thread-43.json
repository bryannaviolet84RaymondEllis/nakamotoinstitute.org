        "content": "<div class=\"post\">A week or so ago I met a very nice Freenoder staffer in the #bitcoin and #bitcoin-dev channels. He told me that the #bitcoin channel turned up on Freenode's radar as it looks like a Botnet Command and Control channel, but after I explained to him how Bitcoin works and why they need IRC, he said that the channel at it's current size is not a problem.<br/><br/>However, this got me thinking and later this week I also discussed the topic on IRC, and I came to the conclusion, that IRC is the wrong method for bootstrapping, especially in it's current form. At the moment, each client will connect to IRC and stay connected. Using /who and join messages, the client will connect to the found IPs on port 8333 as a bootstrapping method. However, the clients internally also talk to each other and broadcast new nodes via the Bitcoin protocol. Still, they are always online in IRC. This has various disadvantages:<br/><br/><ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><li>IRC connectivity is necessary for bootstrapping (firewalls often block it and Freenode blocks TOR)</li><li>There is a single point of failure (Freenode)</li><li>We are leeching Freenode's services instead of using our own infrastructure. Many servers actually disallow bot connections in their MOTDs.</li><li>Minor point: The additional protocol inside Bitcoin brings extra complexity</li></ul><br/>There is already a list of permanently-on Bitcoin IPs around in this forum, which is a nice idea, but not very scalable, thus I propose the following solution: Gnutella and MUTE face very similar bootstrapping problems. To solve them, they rely on a list of \"Gnutella Webcaches\". Those webcaches are run by volunteers on simple PHP servers and a master list of them is distributed with each Gnutella/MUTE release. When a client wants to join the network, it asks one or two of the Webcaches via HTTP for a list of other nodes and also gets added to that list (which is usually a list of the last X clients seen). Every few hours (or days) a running client reconnects to the webcache to tell it, that it is still alive and does not have to be deleted from the list. I suggest, that the same thing is implemented for Bitcoin. Volunteers could run those webcaches on cheap PHP webspace and tell their URL to Satoshi or Sirius, who in turn could add the list to each release. This would allow users running behind a restrictive firewall or TOR to use Bitcoin without manually finding other nodes, and it is a much more scalable approach. (As a bonus we could remove those HTTP calls to whatismyip.com or similar sites).<br/><br/>Of course, there might be a better idea for bootstrapping Bitcoin and I would love to hear it. Or maybe suggestions for the Webcache idea. Please post them here!<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>soultcer</div>",

(This is because we want to have a list of nodes without actually connect to that indexing server.)<br/>And finally, the node is completely connected to the network.<br/>When a new node connects (when it receives a \"new node packet\"), the list is both updated in memory and saved to the hard drive again.<br/>To make updating the list with new nodes so bandwidth friendly as possible, I suggest that every node \"echoes\" the IP of a new node connecting to the network to all the nodes it knows...<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Has bootstrapping in mind.<br/>* Is distributed for clients that have a node list<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* Every new client needs to connect to a server to get a new node list until we're done with bootstrapping.<br/><br/>This, in my eyes, seems like the best solution to our bootstrapping problem...<br/>PS: If we implement this, we might just wanna check if the \"new node packet\" we received contains bogus IPs, or IPs that resolve to .gov domains! <img alt=\"Tongue\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/tongue.gif\"/></div>",

Theoretically a node could send such messages to a global multicast address, and everyone will receive it in a bandwith-efficient way.<br/><br/>That would make bootstrapping in the traditional sense obsolete, since the client would just have to subscribe to the multicast channel. The remaining \"Give me block xyz\" requests could be handled by optionally including a field in messages to the multicast channel that basically says \"My address is 2001:db8::42, and I'm willing to answer direct queries for specific blocks\". After listening to the channel for a while, such a packet should come around, because, at the very least, new blocks will be announced there every so often.</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I like the idea of distributed host caches like Gnutella uses. At the moment, for the majority of people, IRC is a single point of failure. Let's assume that for some reason our Freenode channel was gone. Maybe Freenode got fed up and shut us down. Maybe MenInBlack saw our system, laughed maniacally, and then pressured Freenode to shut us down.<br/><br/>When you start your client, it will do nothing. You could drop to a command line and type \"-addnode\" (or is it -peer? whatever) to connect to a known node, but at that point you'd somehow need to know a node. It probably wouldn't be that hard for one of us, but what about a new user? We could keep a list of peers on the website for them to use, but at that point, they've gone from \"just double click the shiny gold coin and get trading\" to \"check our website for updated peer lists, open command prompt, navigated to the bitcoin directory, and type the proper peer.....\" And if MIB were after us, the website would probably be long since gone.<br/><br/>Of course, we could implement addpeer in a more user-friendly manner. Perhaps a popup that says \"I can't connect to the network. Enter a peer: \" with instructions on some ways to find one, but at that point we're creating a social solution to a technical problem.<br/><br/>Also, if we get bigger we will need to move away from IRC anyway (as implied by the OP's conversation with a Freenode staffer). And what about Tor users? Why should people who want to use Tor to be anonymous have to manually add a peer? <br/><br/>Finally, anyone on Freenode can easily get a list of all running Bitcoin clients, when they came online, when they went offline, etc. That goes against the project's stated goal of anonymity. Of course, with a host cache system, anybody who connected to that cache could be logged by the server operator, but no one operator would have a full picture of the network.<br/><br/>I think the IRC solution is a wonderful beginning, and I applaud how stable it has proven to be. It was a great decision to get the network up easily and concentrate on the more interesting and important considerations in the program.

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">This is a common problem in P2P, known as Original Introduction, although bootstrapping is also a good word for it. The problem with bootstrapping is that you can't decentralize it. Whether it's IRC or HTTP or DNS, the client needs to be hardcoded with an address or list of addresses which is sufficiently fresh that at least one of the listed addresses is still active. After the first node is reached, you are no longer in Original Introduction mode and can use the full range of techniques for decentralization, such as gossip. Unless, of course, you get disconnected from the network and all of your known peers go away, in which case you're back to bootstrapping.<br/><br/>There are two properties that are at odds when you chose a bootstrapping method: robustness (scalability/reliability) and freshness. Robustness is increased at the expense of freshness by caching on multiple servers, as is usually done with HTTP peer lists. Freshness is maximized (at least up to the TCP timeout) at the expense of robustness by having everyone connected, as with IRC. Of course, the key is finding the right mix of robustness and freshness because you need both for the bootstrap to be successful.<br/><br/>Here are some of my current favorite methods for bootstrapping:<br/><br/>Append list of fresh peers to executable or installer dynamically on download. People usually get the application from its official website, so the website is already a point of failure for new users. You're already hardcoding an address in the application, the address that the application will use to bootstrap. So instead just add fresh peers at the moment of download. You need some fancy code in the executable to read the list off the end, but I've implemented this in an NSIS installer and it's not that hard. Most software developers are upset by the idea of this method.<br/><br/>Connect via XMPP to Google App Engine application. This gives the freshness of IRC, but with more robust scaling. App Engine is mostly for writing web apps, but it provides email and XMPP handling as well. It would be simple to write one application that could handle peer lists via either XMPP or HTTP with the same handler code. I'm currently using this in an application and it works well and is very reliable. I only wish there was a second App Engine to use as a fallback because it does have occasional downtime.<br/><br/>An alternative to requiring all nodes to include the complexity of a protocol like IRC or XMPP is to have a few special sentinel nodes which sit on the network and collect addresses of connected nodes via the usual decentralized methods available to an active node. These sentinel nodes periodically upload fresh addresses, say via HTTP POST to a number of websites. A new node can then download a fresh address list from any of the websites which is currently functioning and reachable. If you have 5 sentinels each uploading every 5 minutes (staggered), then you'll have updates roughly once a minute. This is on par with IRC in terms of freshness and is robust as you care to make it by varying the number of HTTP mirrors and the number of sentinels.<br/></div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I think the way eMule handles bootstrapping for its KAD-network is pretty close to optimal:<br/><br/>The list of known peers is stored in a file (nodes.dat), and every client maintains a list of known nodes in that file (sorted by longest uptime, I think -- that's an intrinsic property of Kademlia, but still a good idea). The released client should be accompanied by such a file that contains the addresses of a few reliable peers on static IP addresses, from which a new client can then get more addresses to connect to (and hence store in its own file).<br/><br/>If the \"seed list\" gets out of date, or the server is shut down or something, you can just ask *anyone* in the network to publish his nodes-file (on rapidshare, say), and voila, you've got a fresh list of IPs you can connect to.<br/></div>",
