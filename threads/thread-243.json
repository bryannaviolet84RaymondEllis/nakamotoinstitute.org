Bitcoin's segmentation-fixing mechanisms would seem to keep everything in order.<br/><br/>A similar feature seems to already be planned. Every transaction has the currently-unused \"nLockTime\" field, and this bit of code exists for the UI (the text would appear in the same place as \"x confirmations\"):<br/><div class=\"codeheader\">Code:</div><div class=\"code\">\u00a0 \u00a0 if (!wtx.IsFinal())<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 {<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 if (wtx.nLockTime &lt; 500000000)<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return strprintf(_(\"Open for %d blocks\"), nBestHeight - wtx.nLockTime);<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 else<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return strprintf(_(\"Open until %s\"), DateTimeStr(wtx.nLockTime).c_str());<br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 }</div><br/>Sounds very much like what you're thinking of.</div>",
