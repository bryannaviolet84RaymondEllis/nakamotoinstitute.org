It was decent until around 20:00 GMT February 21st, but after that my machine (4 core I7) produced only one block for entire &gt;12 hours. And there isn't even a clue for new difficulty hike in the debug log.<br/><br/>Here are my possible scenarios:<br/><br/>1. Some big BC bot came along.<br/><br/>2. Someone is trying some kind of DoSing the system.<br/><br/>3. Someone built a bitcoin mod with GPGPU (CUDA or sorts) support.<br/><br/>4. Some kind of growth problem (i.g. we reached first of a kind network size and there is problem with that).<br/><br/>Ideas?</div>",
