        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Hey,<br/><br/>So there is another thread asking about bc and decimal places. It is stated that the client(s) only show 2 decimal places, but there are 8 in total. Now, working on stuff, I find that it would be nice if I could transfer at least 4 decimals precision, but the full 8 would be great.<br/><br/>Looking at the code it seems simple enough to remove the rounding from bitcoind, but what about the receiving side? If it's a non UI client, then it will show everything, but would I be making things overly confusing for GUI clients?<br/><br/>Is there any shortcoming in me patching my client to handle full precision?</div>",

I wasn't aware of it being that way.<br/><br/>And yes, I am rounding for now, but I like things clean, and I can either allow withdrawal of higher precision amounts, or I can round to 2 decimals the prize handout, I just rather do the former, that's all.<br/><br/>And no, it's not *only* for the sportsbook.
