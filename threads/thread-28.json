        "content": "<div class=\"post\">I am having 0 luck attempting to compile w/wxWidgets. Trying to compile wx from source was a no-go (various syntax errors I didn't really delve into), downloaded latest precompiled wx packages for ubuntu karmic, but they do not match up to your static links far as I can tell. I guess what I'm getting at is, rather than try to sort out these issues, I'd really love a .deb &lt;.&lt; I'd like to participate - as an agorist and a fan of cryptoanarchic theory this is sort of a fantasy of mine, but there is frankly no way I will dual boot windows or run this in as insecure an environment as a VM. <br/><br/>DEB isn't a bad route, you'll hit the vast majority of desktop linux users, most of whom won't be buggered to try compiling in the first place, so I don't think it's entirely unreasonable. Alternatively if you are interested in helping me work out compilation issues I would be happy to provide x86_64 binaries for ubuntu as long as I am compiling them. I haven't done .debs before but I am sure I can figure that out. Let me know <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/></div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Sorry, I should have mentioned more clearly that I am running AMD64. I was trying to compile with 0.2.0, so that would explain a lot of my issues. I *would* like to have a native 64 bit binary, but it sounds like that isn't going to happen right now. I have ia32-lib already, I'll try running what you've supplied, and failing that Wine might be an option. Thanks for the help. I don't remember coming across SVN links on the download page, but once you get up to wxWidgets2.9 I may try again. I could *not* get 2.8.10 to compile for me, I'm sure I probably was overlooking something, but it sounds like 2.9 at least resolves the utf-8/ansi issue <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/></div>",
