Large companies such as Google, Microsoft, Wal-mart etc are very susceptible to government regulations.<br/></div><br/>Screw big business. Google, Microsoft and Wal-Mart can all eat flaming death as far as I'm concerned, creatures of state privilege as they are.<br/><br/>My task, and where systems like Bitcoin can be helpful, is in making both government and big business irrelevant and obsolete.<br/></div><br/>I'm only saying that it may be difficult for bitcoin to go mainstream, but i seriously doubt they can stop adoption in general.<br/>They would have to shut down the internet entirely, which is not easy (possible breaking ICANN is not enough, we can always use alternative DNS roots).<br/></div><br/>Gotcha. It's just a difference of emphasis, really.<br/><br/>I believe very strongly that a successful effort to supplant state money is going to be a ground-up effort. The big players in today's pink economy are going to be the last to adapt, kicking and screaming, to the new economic reality. For years before that happens, though, individuals, sole traders and small enterprises are going to be taking more and more of their income away as, simultaneously, a) the new monetary system's benefits impact more and more people, b) the inevitable institutional dumbness of big organizations makes them stumble and lag, and, c) continually eroding confidence in the state, its institutions and the entities that rely upon them drives more and more people into the new economy.<br/><br/>If you're reading this, you're part of the vanguard building the new economy and the new world. Mainstream acceptance will come by weight of numbers and via network effects. Who ever heard of Wikileaks or Twitter four years ago? And today we've got Admiral Chairman-of-the-Joint-Fucking-Chiefs Mullen tweeting his dismay over Wikileaks -- no doubt via the intermediation of an office full of PR analysts and bureaucrats, at extremely low relative impact.<br/><br/>BTW, Shadow, when they shut down the internet, I know how to build a new one.

In this case, blood is spilled.<br/><br/>The street protests means that.<br/></div>Oh, I imagine the government must be really scared of trying to attack its population with the most modern weapons money can buy. An armed struggle will just destabilize the country, but will not have any effect on the government if they want (look at dictatorships), unless the military decides to stop supporting the government (which is why unmanned vehicles are getting so popular). <br/><br/>We are going to a society in which the president can select all the demonstrators from a database (automatically based on camera data, of course), press one button and kill all of them. This might be done by sending missiles, but it could also be done by analysing the DNA, finding a biochemical agent which mysteriously kills a particular part of the population of just one specific individual (they can create flying machines the size of a musquito already that no doubt could also be equipped with some untraceable poison). You can do it slowly enough, and the people will never notice what hit them. You also don't have to completely kill them, you just have to weaken them. For an example of that look at the presidential candidate of some Eastern-Europe country that was poisoned. <br/><br/>This might sound radical, but I am not the one who invented the every increasing more efficient weaponry on which the US (and other nations) spend about a trillion dollars a year. Everything in the previous paragraph is technically already possible, and 80% is probably already implemented or could be operational in a year after the system is desired. Systems of control like that simply have never existed before in history.<br/><br/>In a country in which there exists an asymmetric power balance between large parts of the population and the government, you get tyranny. I am not suggesting that everyone should have access to their own nuclear bomb, but owning a gun or even a tank (if lots of people in the community vouch for you for example) should be perfectly reasonable and perhaps even mandatory. </div>",

The big players in today's pink economy are going to be the last to adapt, kicking and screaming, to the new economic reality. For years before that happens, though, individuals, sole traders and small enterprises are going to be taking more and more of their income away as, simultaneously, a) the new monetary system's benefits impact more and more people, b) the inevitable institutional dumbness of big organizations makes them stumble and lag, and, c) continually eroding confidence in the state, its institutions and the entities that rely upon them drives more and more people into the new economy.<br/><br/>If you're reading this, you're part of the vanguard building the new economy and the new world. Mainstream acceptance will come by weight of numbers and via network effects. Who ever heard of Wikileaks or Twitter four years ago? And today we've got Admiral Chairman-of-the-Joint-Fucking-Chiefs Mullen tweeting his dismay over Wikileaks -- no doubt via the intermediation of an office full of PR analysts and bureaucrats, at extremely low relative impact.<br/><br/>BTW, Shadow, when they shut down the internet, I know how to build a new one.

Horning<br/>Logan, Utah</div>",

If Bitcoin blows up, a new system can be build without this flaw. The probability of Bitcoin _not_ containing some fatal flaw is pretty small (as almost all software has flaws).<br/><br/>All Wikileaks needs to do is say \"Following the PayPal incident we have decided to accept a new kind of payment, Bitcoins. You can find more information on donating via Bitcoins on URL &lt;some suitable URL hosted by Wikileaks&gt;. \u00a0\"<br/><br/>They could post it in their news section or something like that. It is possible that main stream media would pick it up if they would contrast Bitcoin with PayPal like that. </div>",
