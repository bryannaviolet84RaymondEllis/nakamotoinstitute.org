        "content": "<div class=\"post\">Summary: Giving BitCoin a decentralized escrow would give it an advantage over all other exchange mediums, which might increase its adoption rate.\u00a0 Details follow.<br/><br/>For a <i>decentralized</i> currency, <i>centralized</i> escrows seem to be the norm for BitCoin today.\u00a0 An example:<br/><br/>Alice wants to buy $5 USD worth of BitCoins from Bob, but neither Alice nor Bob fully trust the other, so they go to a site they both trust--say Mt. Gox. There they deposit their respective monies and there they have Mt. Gox make the exchange for them.<br/><br/>No offense to Mt. Gox (a site I like), but can we do without its escrow service?<br/><br/>An almost distributed alternative: <br/><br/><ul style=\"margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;\"><li> Charlie, a trusted third-party, generates a BitCoin private key.</li><li> Charlie then uses the Unix command <tt>split</tt> to split the private key in half--giving one half to Alice and one half to Bob.</li><li> Bob deposits $5 USD worth of BitCoins into the split BitCoin account;</li><li> Alice verifies the transaction using the public block; </li><li> Alice sends $5 USD to Bob by PayPal; </li><li> Bob verifies the PayPal transaction; </li><li> Bob sends Alice his half of the split private key so Alice can access the BitCoins he deposited earlier.</li></ul><br/>(For simplicity I omit part of the PayPal details like who pays the transaction fee and how long you should wait to avoid chargeback fraud.\u00a0 I also omit any incentive for Bob to perform the final step.)<br/><br/>More advanced almost-distributed examples can be made if we substitute something more sophisticated for the Unix command <tt>split</tt>. For example: a Shamir's secret sharing scheme implementation like <tt>ssss</tt>[1]. A utility like <tt>ssss</tt> allows Alice and Bob to appoint an arbiter in case they get in a disagreement.<br/><br/>The problem with all of this, of course, is that we must trust Charlie to not abuse the full copy of the private key he creates.<br/><br/>The ideal solution would be for Alice and Bob to each generate half of the private key on their own. I don't fully understand the math used in modern keypairs, but I doubt this is possible with the current algorithm.<br/><br/>Is there an alternative way for Alice and Bob to each acquire half of a private key without giving the whole key to any party?<br/><br/>-Dave<br/><br/>[1] See: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing</a><br/></div>",
