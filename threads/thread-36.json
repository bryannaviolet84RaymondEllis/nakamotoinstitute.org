Without looking at the source code, let's assume the probability for this is 2^(-128) for a keyspace of 128 bits. See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier#Random_UUID_probability_of_duplicates\">here</a> for a perspective on how probable it is with a 122 bit collision.<br/><br/>However, if something similar to the <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/282230/\">Debian ssl-scandal happens</a>, similar keys could indeed be generated. The effect of an individual generating an existing key, is (if I understand it correctly) in effect to make a copy of wallet.dat.

They would share the wallet, and it becomes a race on spending the money first.<br/><br/><div class=\"quoteheader\"><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=62.msg437#msg437\">Quote from: NewLibertyStandard on February 23, 2010, 09:22:47 AM</a></div><div class=\"quote\">I was referring to the custom Bitcoin addresses which you can label with the name of the person who is going to send you bitcoins so that you know from whom the payment came.

That means, every address has an associated private key. When you click \"New Address\", you call GenerateKey in main.cpp, which generates a new key pair. So the duplicate address is ultimately a duplicate public key. Which is <i>very</i> unlikely. <br/><br/>While keys still are \"easily generated\", you should have to generate a whole lot of keys before a collision. While I am not certain, it seems that the keys generated have a space of 256 bits, which is a lot more than the 122 bits put in perspective in the wikipedia article on uuids. Remember, 123 bits have half the probability of collision as 122 bit, 124 half of that again etc.</div>",
