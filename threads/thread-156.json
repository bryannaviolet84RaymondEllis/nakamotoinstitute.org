Start Bitcoin on system startup is grayed out although I have added it manually to my login items. I have not tried \"Limit coin generation to 'x' processors\" or \"Connect through socks4 proxy:\", but I can only guess that these options are not working either.<br/><br/><del><i>CPU Usage:</i> when generating coins top shows Bitcoin at ~187% CPU...this seems extreme?</del> A friend just explained what a \"nice process\" is. Sorry.<br/><br/><i>Crash On Close:</i> about ever other time I attempt to close Bitcoin using Bitcoin &gt;&gt; Quit the app crashes rather than closing like a friendly app should.<br/><i><br/>Coin Generation:</i> frankly I am trusting that this is NOT a bug, but just bad luck. I have been running the app for a few weeks now with zero generation. Again, I assume this is bad luck, but considering the other problems I wanted to mention it in case others were noticing this that were using my setup as well.<br/><br/>-----------<br/>If there are any known solution to these problems or if there is anything I can do to help sort them out please let me know. Thanks!<br/><br/></div>",
