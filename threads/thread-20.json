I have had 2 machines connected (getting 4+ connections on each) and generating Bitcoins on the same static IP address. The port 8333 is of course forwarded for connection through my firewall, which I guess is what you mean. However, connections to other nodes are made without port 8333 being specifically forwarded through my router to a specific machine (sub-net IP), which is of course the best way to max connectivity. I understand Bitcoin only requires 1 other connection for transactions, yes ?<br/><br/>I think my original question was valid and thanks for clarifying this everyone. NewLibertyStandard I think is correct \"If I remember correctly I think I was told that they would be sent to the first bitcoin application with whom the sender connects.\"<br/><br/>I dislike communication on forums, it's hard to discuss topics sometimes when all parties mean the same thing and communicate it in a different way ! <img alt=\"Smiley\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/smiley.gif\"/> <br/><br/>I have enough internet connections, routers and PC equipment - So, I'm off to make an 'official' test for myself whilst I RTM\u00a0 <img alt=\"Grin\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://bitcointalk.org/Smileys/default/grin.gif\"/></div>",
